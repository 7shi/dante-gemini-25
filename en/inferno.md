## Canto 1

The narrator, in the middle of his life, finds himself lost in a dark wood, having strayed from the correct path. He describes the terror the wood inspires, but feels his fear recede when he reaches a hill whose peak is lit by the sun's rays. After a brief rest, he begins to ascend the slope.

As the narrator begins to climb the hill, he is confronted by three beasts in succession: a swift leopard, a ravenous lion, and a gaunt she-wolf. The first two inspire fear, but the third, the she-wolf, fills him with such oppressive despair that he loses all hope of reaching the sunlit peak and is driven back down into the darkness of the valley.

As the narrator falls back into the dark valley, he is met by a figure who seems faint from long silence. The narrator begs this figure—be it shade or man—for mercy. The spirit identifies himself as the poet Virgil, who lived under Augustus in the time of the “false and lying gods.” Virgil asks why the narrator is turning away from the joyful mountain. Overcome, the narrator recognizes his master and inspiration, praising Virgil's poetic style and pleading for help against the she-wolf that blocks his path and makes him tremble with fear.

Virgil explains to the narrator that he cannot pass the she-wolf and must take another path. He prophesies the coming of a "Greyhound" who will defeat the beast and save Italy. Virgil then offers to guide the narrator through Hell and Purgatory. To ascend to Heaven, however, a more worthy guide will be necessary, as Virgil, a pagan, is barred from God's city. The narrator accepts, begging Virgil to lead him away from his peril. Virgil sets off, and the narrator follows.

## Canto 2

As dusk falls, the narrator, alone among resting creatures, prepares for his arduous journey. He invokes the Muses and his own memory for aid before expressing his profound doubts to Virgil. He feels unworthy, comparing himself unfavorably to Aeneas and St. Paul, who both undertook journeys to the afterlife for divinely ordained purposes—the founding of Rome and the establishment of the Church. Fearing his own quest is mere folly, the narrator's resolve wavers, and like a man who changes his mind, he finds himself wanting to abandon the enterprise he had just so eagerly accepted.

Virgil responds to the narrator's cowardice by revealing the true origin of his mission. He recounts how Beatrice descended from Heaven into Limbo to ask for his help, explaining that the narrator is lost and in peril. Beatrice herself was prompted by Saint Lucia, who in turn was sent by a compassionate lady in Heaven (the Virgin Mary). After relaying this story of divine intercession, Virgil chastises the narrator for his hesitation, asking why he harbors fear when three blessed ladies in Heaven are watching over him and Virgil's own speech promises a good outcome.

Revived by Virgil's account of heavenly intervention, the narrator's courage is renewed, like a wilted flower blooming in the sun. He thanks both Beatrice for her compassion and Virgil for his swift obedience. Reaffirming his original decision to undertake the journey, he proclaims Virgil his leader, lord, and master, and the two set off together on the arduous path.

## Canto 3

Virgil and the narrator arrive at the Gate of Hell and read its famous, terrifying inscription. The narrator expresses his fear at the words' meaning. Virgil reassures him, telling him to cast off all cowardice, and explains they are about to see the souls who have lost God. He then takes the narrator's hand and leads him through the gate.

Upon entering the Ante-Inferno, the narrator is overwhelmed by a cacophony of sighs, cries, and wails. Virgil explains that this is the punishment for the neutral souls—those who in life were committed to neither good nor evil, living 'without infamy and without praise,' along with the angels who did not side with God or Lucifer. Rejected by both Heaven and deep Hell, they endlessly chase a blank banner, stung by wasps and hornets, their blood and tears feeding worms on the ground. The narrator recognizes the shade of him 'who made through cowardice the great refusal' and understands that this is the fate of the wretched, displeasing to both God and His enemies.

The narrator sees souls eager to cross a great river. Virgil identifies it as Acheron and promises an explanation upon their arrival at its shore. The ferryman, Charon, appears, shouting at the damned souls and ordering the narrator, a living being, to leave. When the narrator doesn't move, Charon prophesies that he will cross by a different, lighter boat. Virgil silences Charon by invoking divine will, and the ferryman's fiery eyes are pacified.

The damned souls, hearing Charon's cruel words, blaspheme and weep as they gather on the wicked shore. Charon the demon, with eyes like burning coals, herds them into his boat, striking any who linger. The souls cast themselves from the shore one by one, like autumn leaves or birds responding to a call. Virgil explains to the narrator that divine justice spurs these souls, turning their fear into desire, and that Charon's anger at the narrator is a good sign, as no saved soul ever crosses this river. As he finishes, the ground trembles violently, a red light flashes, and the narrator faints from terror.

## Canto 4

The narrator awakens from his faint at the brink of the abyss, the first circle of Hell. Virgil, whose pallor the narrator mistakes for fear, explains it is pity for the souls within. They enter Limbo, a place not of torment but of endless, sorrowful sighs from the spirits of unbaptized infants and virtuous pagans. Virgil explains that these souls, including himself, did not sin but are lost because they lived without the Christian faith. Their only punishment is to live in desire for God without hope of ever seeing Him. Hearing this, the narrator is filled with great sorrow for these worthy souls.

The narrator asks Virgil if anyone has ever escaped Limbo. Virgil describes the Harrowing of Hell, when Christ descended and rescued the great patriarchs of the Old Testament. As they continue walking, they see a light in the distance illuminating a hemisphere of darkness. This light emanates from a place occupied by honorable souls. When the narrator asks who they are, Virgil explains their earthly fame has earned them this privileged position. A voice from the group then announces Virgil's return.

Virgil and the narrator are met by four great shades: the classical poets Homer, Horace, Ovid, and Lucan. They honor Virgil and welcome the narrator into their group as the sixth member. Together, they walk toward a light, speaking of things the narrator deems inappropriate to repeat. They arrive at a noble castle with seven walls and a small river, which they cross as if it were solid ground. Inside, in a green meadow, they see other souls of great authority and gentle demeanor.

Inside the noble castle in Limbo, the narrator sees a host of great figures from history and myth. He lists heroes and heroines of Troy and Rome, including Hector, Aeneas, Caesar, and Camilla. He then sees a group of philosophers led by Aristotle, 'the master of those who know,' surrounded by Socrates, Plato, and others. Finally, he names great physicians and scientists like Avicenna and Averroës. Stating he cannot name them all, he explains that he and Virgil leave the other four poets and depart from the tranquil light of Limbo, descending into a darker, trembling air.

## Canto 5

The narrator and Virgil descend from Limbo to the Second Circle of Hell, which is smaller but filled with more pain. Here, the monstrous judge Minos examines each arriving soul, coils his tail a number of times to indicate the circle of their damnation, and casts them down. Minos challenges the narrator, but Virgil silences him by invoking divine will, allowing them to pass.

The narrator enters the Second Circle of Hell, a dark place buffeted by an eternal, violent storm. He learns that this is the punishment for the 'carnal sinners'—those who allowed desire to overcome reason. These souls are endlessly swept through the air like flocks of starlings and cranes, with no hope of rest. Seeing a specific line of shades, the narrator asks Virgil who they are.

Virgil identifies several famous historical and mythological figures punished for lust, including Semiramis, Dido, and Cleopatra. Overcome with pity, the narrator asks to speak with one particular pair of souls who fly together. Virgil instructs him to call out to them in the name of love. When the narrator does so, the two souls separate from the larger group and float toward him like doves answering a call.

One of the souls, Francesca da Rimini, addresses the narrator. She tells the story of how she and her lover, Paolo, fell in love while reading the romance of Lancelot and Guinevere. When they read of the first kiss, Paolo kissed her, an act that led to their affair and murder by Francesca's husband. She states that Caina awaits their killer. Overwhelmed by pity at her tale and the sight of the weeping Paolo, the narrator faints.

## Canto 6

The narrator awakens in the Third Circle of Hell, where the gluttonous are eternally punished by a foul, freezing rain. They are guarded and tormented by the three-headed monster Cerberus, who claws and flays them as they lie in the putrid mud. When Cerberus confronts the travelers, Virgil pacifies the beast by throwing handfuls of earth into its three greedy mouths, allowing them to pass.

The narrator and Virgil walk over the shades of the gluttons. One shade, Ciacco of Florence, sits up and speaks with the narrator. After the narrator fails to recognize him due to his tormented state, Ciacco identifies himself and delivers the first major political prophecy of the Inferno, foretelling the strife between the Black and White Guelphs in Florence. The narrator, distressed, asks Ciacco about the fate of other famous Florentines. Ciacco informs him they are in lower Hell for graver sins. He then asks the narrator to remember him on Earth before his eyes twist and he falls back among the other shades.

Virgil explains that Ciacco will not rise again until the Last Judgment, when all souls will be reunited with their bodies. This prompts the narrator to ask if their torments will increase after this reunion. Virgil replies, citing philosophical principles, that because a being's capacity for feeling increases with its completeness, the souls, being more complete with their bodies restored, will feel their suffering more acutely. They continue on their way, speaking more than the narrator relates, until they reach the edge of the Third Circle and see Plutus, the guardian of the next.

## Canto 7

Plutus, guardian of the Fourth Circle, confronts the travelers with a garbled threat. Virgil rebukes him with divine authority, causing the demon to collapse. They descend into the circle for the avaricious and the prodigal, where Dante sees the souls clashing against each other endlessly, like the waves over the whirlpool of Charybdis.

In the Fourth Circle, the narrator witnesses the punishment of the avaricious and the prodigal. In two opposing groups, they roll immense weights with their chests, clashing violently and endlessly shouting accusations at each other. Virgil explains that their sin was a lack of moderation with worldly goods, and identifies many high-ranking clergy among the avaricious. He states that their squalid former lives have rendered them unrecognizable in death, and reflects on the futility of the earthly riches for which humanity struggles.

The narrator asks Virgil to explain the nature of Fortune. Virgil describes Fortune not as a random force but as a divinely appointed angelic minister, a 'goddess' who redistributes worldly wealth and power according to God's hidden plan. Her actions are beyond human comprehension and control. She is often unjustly blamed by mankind but remains blessed and content in her work. Virgil concludes by urging the narrator onward, noting that time is passing and they must descend to the next circle.

Virgil and the narrator descend to the Fifth Circle, the marshy swamp of Styx. They see the souls of the wrathful fighting each other in the foul mud. Virgil explains that submerged beneath them are the sullen, whose sighs cause the water to bubble. They gurgle a distorted lament for their joyless lives. The poets walk along the edge of the marsh until they arrive at the foot of a tall tower.

## Canto 8

Continuing from the end of the last canto, the narrator describes seeing two signal flames lit atop the high tower, answered by another flame far in the distance. When he asks Virgil their meaning, Virgil tells him a boat is approaching through the marsh. A skiff, steered by the wrathful ferryman Phlegyas, rushes toward them. Phlegyas angrily challenges the narrator, but Virgil silences him, explaining they only need passage across the mire. Virgil and the narrator board the boat, which visibly sinks under the narrator's living weight, a detail that distinguishes him from the weightless shades.

While crossing the marsh of Styx, the narrator is accosted by a mud-caked, wrathful soul whom he recognizes as Filippo Argenti. The narrator harshly rejects him, an act for which Virgil praises him, calling his indignation righteous. The narrator then expresses a desire to see Argenti punished further, a wish that is immediately fulfilled as the other spirits in the swamp fall upon Argenti and tear him apart. As they leave the scene, the narrator hears new sounds of wailing, heralding their approach to the city of Dis.

Virgil tells the narrator they are approaching the city of Dis. The narrator sees its red towers, which Virgil explains are glowing from the eternal fire within. They arrive at the city walls, which seem to be made of iron, and their ferryman, Phlegyas, commands them to disembark at the entrance.

At the gates of the city of Dis, the travelers are confronted by over a thousand fallen angels who furiously deny entry to the narrator, a living being. Virgil attempts to negotiate, but the demons slam the gates shut, leaving him outside. The narrator despairs, but Virgil, though visibly shaken, reassures him. He explains that the demons' defiance is not new, recalling how they were defeated at the upper gate of Hell, and prophesies that a heavenly messenger is already on the way to force the gate open for them.

## Canto 9

Seeing the narrator turn pale with fear, Virgil quickly hides his own dismay at being turned away from Dis. Virgil's broken attempt at reassurance, however, only frightens the narrator more. To test his guide, the narrator asks if anyone from Limbo has ever descended this deep. Virgil replies that it is rare, but that he himself was once conjured by the sorceress Erichtho to go to the very bottom of Hell. He thus knows the way perfectly, but affirms they cannot enter the city without a wrathful intervention.

As Virgil speaks, the narrator is distracted by the sudden appearance of three Furies atop a tower at the entrance to Dis. The blood-stained, snake-haired monsters, handmaidens of Proserpina, threaten the narrator and call for Medusa to turn him to stone. Virgil immediately orders the narrator to turn around and, not trusting him to obey, covers his eyes with his own hands to protect him from the Gorgon's petrifying gaze. The poet then directly addresses the reader, urging those with 'sound intellects' to perceive the hidden allegorical meaning beneath the 'veil of the strange verses.'

A heavenly messenger arrives, walking over the marsh of Styx, scattering the terrified souls of the damned. With a mere touch of a small wand, he opens the gates of Dis, which the fallen angels had barred. He scolds the demons for their futile defiance against divine will, referencing Cerberus's past defeat by Hercules as a precedent. Without speaking to the poets, he immediately departs, and Virgil and the narrator, now safe, proceed into the city.

Having entered the city of Dis, the narrator finds himself in the Sixth Circle. The landscape is a vast plain filled with open, fiery tombs from which cries of pain emerge. Virgil explains that this is the punishment for heretics, who are buried in these heated sarcophagi. They then proceed to walk between the tombs and the city's high walls.

## Canto 10

The narrator and Virgil walk on a narrow path between the fiery tombs of the heretics and the wall of the city of Dis. The narrator asks if it's possible to see the souls inside the tombs, since their lids are open. Virgil explains that the tombs will be sealed shut on Judgment Day when the souls are reunited with their bodies. He identifies these heretics as Epicurus and his followers, who believed the soul dies with the body. Virgil also perceives an unspoken question in the narrator's heart, promising it too will soon be answered.

A voice from a tomb addresses the narrator, recognizing his Florentine speech. Virgil encourages him to speak with the soul, who is the Ghibelline leader Farinata. Rising proudly from his fiery tomb, Farinata asks about the narrator's ancestors. Upon learning they are Guelphs, he boasts of exiling them twice. The narrator retorts that his party learned the art of returning, unlike Farinata's.

While the narrator speaks with the Ghibelline leader Farinata, another soul, Cavalcante de' Cavalcanti, rises from the same tomb. He asks why his son, the poet Guido, is not with the narrator if the journey is undertaken due to intellectual merit. The narrator's reply uses a past-tense verb in reference to Guido, which the father misinterprets as a sign that his son is dead. When the narrator hesitates to clarify, Cavalcante falls back into the tomb in despair.

Farinata continues their political exchange, prophesying Dante's exile. He then explains why Florentines hate his family (due to the Battle of Montaperti), but boasts of having single-handedly saved the city from destruction. Dante asks how the damned can see the future but not the present. Farinata explains their foresight is limited to distant events and will cease at the Last Judgment. Realizing his error, Dante asks Farinata to tell Cavalcante his son is still alive. Farinata names Frederick II and a Cardinal as his tomb-mates before disappearing. Troubled by the prophecy, Dante is reassured by Virgil, who tells him Beatrice will ultimately explain his life's journey. They then proceed toward the next circle, following a foul-smelling path.

## Canto 11

The narrator and Virgil reach the edge of a cliff leading to the Seventh Circle. Overcome by a terrible stench, they pause behind a large tomb belonging to Pope Anastasius II. Virgil explains they must wait for their senses to adjust to the smell, and the narrator asks him to use the waiting time for instruction so it is not wasted.

Virgil explains the structure of Lower Hell to the narrator. It consists of three circles punishing sins of malice: violence (Circle 7), simple fraud (Circle 8), and treacherous fraud (Circle 9). He details the three types of violence (against neighbor, self, and God) and the two types of fraud (against strangers and against those who have a special bond of trust), explaining why fraud, which misuses human reason, is considered a graver sin than violence.

The narrator asks Virgil why the sinners of the upper circles (the lustful, gluttonous, avaricious, and wrathful) are punished outside the city of Dis, and not within it, if God is angry with them. Virgil rebukes him for forgetting the teachings of Aristotle's *Ethics*, which distinguishes the sin of incontinence from the graver sins of malice and bestiality. He explains that since incontinence offends God less, these souls are punished less severely and are kept separate from the more wicked souls within the city.

The narrator asks Virgil to explain why usury offends God. Virgil clarifies that humanity should live by following nature and art (labor), which are, respectively, God's daughter and granddaughter. The usurer scorns this divine plan. Virgil then points to the stars to indicate the late hour and urges the narrator to move on toward the cliff leading to the next circle.

## Canto 12

The narrator and Virgil arrive at a rugged, broken cliff leading down to the Seventh Circle. Guarding the path is the Minotaur, the "infamy of Crete." When the Minotaur sees them, it bites itself in a fit of rage. Virgil taunts the beast, reminding it that the narrator is not its slayer, Theseus, nor guided by its sister, Ariadne. The Minotaur thrashes about like a mortally wounded bull, and Virgil urges the narrator to hurry down the path while the creature is distracted by its fury.

As they descend the landslide, Virgil explains it was caused by the earthquake at Christ's death. He points out the approaching Phlegethon, the river of blood where the violent against others are punished. The narrator laments the human capacity for greed and rage before seeing centaurs patrolling the riverbank.

As the poets descend, three centaurs with bows—Nessus, Chiron, and Pholus—separate from their troop to challenge them. Virgil identifies the three and explains their role in shooting any soul that rises too far out of the river of blood. Chiron, the leader, notices the narrator is alive because he moves things he touches. Virgil explains that their journey is divinely ordained, not for pleasure, and requests a guide. Chiron commands Nessus to lead them and ensure their safe passage.

The centaur Nessus guides the poets along the river of blood, pointing out famous tyrants like Alexander the Great submerged to their eyebrows. He then shows them murderers submerged to their throats, and highwaymen in the shallower parts. Nessus explains that the river circles back, getting deeper again to punish the tyrants on the other side. He names more sinners before turning back across the ford.

## Canto 13

After crossing the river of blood, the narrator and Virgil enter a strange, dark, pathless forest. This is the second round of the Seventh Circle, where the suicides are punished by being turned into gnarled, poisoned trees. The Harpies nest in their branches. Hearing disembodied wails, the narrator is confused. Virgil, guessing his thoughts, tells him to break a twig. When the narrator does, the tree cries out, bleeds, and speaks, rebuking him for his cruelty and revealing its human past. Struck with terror, the narrator drops the branch.

Virgil apologizes to the wounded soul, who identifies himself as Pier della Vigna, a formerly trusted advisor to Emperor Frederick II. Pier recounts how envy led to his downfall and suicide, swearing he was always faithful to his lord. At Virgil's prompting, Pier then explains the fate of the suicides: after being judged by Minos, their souls fall into the forest, sprout into trees, and are tormented by the Harpies. He adds that on Judgment Day, they will reclaim their bodies only to hang them on the branches of their thorny, tormented selves.

While the poets are still speaking with the soul of Pier della Vigna, they are startled by the sound of two naked, scratched souls—the wastrels—fleeing through the forest. They are pursued by a pack of black hounds who catch the slower of the two, Lano, tear him apart, and carry off his limbs. The other wastrel, Jacopo da Santo Andrea, had hidden in a bush, which is itself the soul of another suicide. The bush cries out in pain from the damage. Virgil questions this new soul, an anonymous Florentine who hanged himself in his own home. The soul asks the narrator to gather its broken leaves and laments the perpetual strife of Florence, which he attributes to its pagan founder, Mars.

## Canto 14

After gathering the leaves for the Florentine suicide, the narrator and Virgil reach the third round of the Seventh Circle. They find a barren plain of burning sand, ringed by the Wood of the Suicides. Here, naked souls are punished by a slow rain of fire. The narrator observes three distinct groups of sinners: those lying supine, those sitting huddled, and those walking endlessly. The scene is compared to the Libyan desert trod by Cato and to a legend of Alexander the Great encountering falling flames in India.

The narrator asks Virgil about a giant, prideful soul lying in the burning sand who seems unfazed by the rain of fire. This soul, overhearing the question, boasts that he is the same in death as he was in life and that even Jupiter could not get a satisfying vengeance on him. Virgil identifies him as Capaneus, one of the seven kings who besieged Thebes, and explains that his unquenched pride is his greatest punishment. Virgil then instructs the narrator to follow him carefully, keeping to the edge of the wood to avoid the hot sand.

The narrator and Virgil arrive at a small, red stream flowing out of the wood and across the burning plain. Its stone banks provide a safe path. Virgil states that this stream, which extinguishes the falling flames above it, is the most remarkable thing they have seen since entering Hell. This piques the narrator's curiosity, and he asks for a full explanation.

Virgil explains the origin of the infernal rivers, which all flow from the tears of a giant statue, the Old Man of Crete. These tears form Acheron, Styx, and Phlegethon, eventually pooling into Cocytus. He answers the narrator's questions about the geography of Hell and the location of Lethe, which is in Purgatory, before urging him to continue along the safe path provided by the stream's banks.

## Canto 15

The narrator and Virgil walk along one of the hard stone banks of a stream crossing the burning plain. The banks, compared to the dykes of Flanders and Padua, are protected from the fiery rain by the steam rising from the water. Having walked so far that the wood behind them is out of sight, they encounter a troop of souls walking along the bank who squint intently to see them in the dim light.

The narrator is recognized by a soul who grabs his hem. The narrator identifies this scorched figure as his former mentor, Brunetto Latini. Brunetto explains that he cannot stop walking without incurring a hundred-year penalty, but offers to walk alongside the narrator for a time before rejoining his suffering troop. The narrator, showing deep respect, lowers his head to speak with him from the elevated path.

Brunetto Latini asks the narrator how he came to be in Hell before his time. The narrator explains he was lost but is now being guided by Virgil. Brunetto prophesies that the narrator is destined for glory but will face persecution from the corrupt Florentines. He urges the narrator to remain separate from them. The narrator expresses deep gratitude for Brunetto's past teachings on achieving immortality through fame and says he will remember this prophecy to have it explained later by Beatrice. He defiantly accepts whatever Fortune has in store. Virgil, overhearing, commends his student's resolve.

Brunetto Latini points out some of his fellow sufferers—notably the grammarian Priscian and the jurist Francesco d'Accorso—but says he must be silent about the rest. He asks the narrator to remember his great work, the *Tesoro*. Seeing another group of souls approaching, with whom he cannot mingle, Brunetto departs, running like a victor in a race rather than a loser.

## Canto 16

The narrator and Virgil arrive near a great waterfall when three noble Florentine souls—punished among the sodomites—break from their group and run toward them. To converse without stopping (which would incur a greater penalty), they form a wheel, constantly circling while keeping their faces turned to the narrator. One of them, Iacopo Rusticucci, appeals to their shared fame, asking the narrator to identify himself. He then introduces his companions, Guido Guerra and Tegghiaio Aldobrandi, and himself, blaming his damnation on his 'savage wife.'

The narrator expresses his deep respect for the three Florentine souls, explaining he would have jumped down to embrace them if not for the fire. They ask him about the state of virtue in Florence. He laments that new money and pride have corrupted the city. Pleased with his direct answer, they ask him to speak of them when he returns to the world. They then quickly run off, and Virgil decides it is time for them to move on.

The narrator and Virgil arrive at a great waterfall marking the edge of the Seventh Circle. On Virgil's command, the narrator removes a cord he wears, with which he had once hoped to catch the leopard from Canto I. Virgil throws the cord into the abyss as a signal. Reading the narrator's unasked question, Virgil confirms that something is being summoned. The narrator, swearing to the reader that his tale is true despite its strangeness, then sees a marvelous figure swimming up through the dark air.

## Canto 17

Virgil announces the arrival of Geryon, the beast of Fraud, who has been summoned from the abyss. The narrator describes Geryon's monstrous form in detail: it has the face of an honest man, the body of a serpent covered in intricate patterns, hairy paws, and a scorpion's tail. The beast perches on the edge of the cliff, part on land and part over the void, like a beaver waiting for prey.

Virgil directs the narrator to detour toward the monstrous Geryon. To avoid the burning sand, they walk along the very edge of the precipice. Virgil then sends the narrator alone to observe a group of sinners—the usurers—who are sitting nearby, while he negotiates with Geryon for passage. The narrator observes these souls frantically waving their hands to ward off the fiery rain and hot ground, comparing them to dogs tormented by summer insects.

The narrator observes the usurers, who are unrecognizable due to their punishment. He identifies them by the coats of arms on the money pouches hanging from their necks. One soul, a Paduan, speaks to him, angrily asking what he is doing there. The soul then prophesies the damnation of two other famous usurers before making a grotesque gesture. Fearing he has overstayed his welcome, the narrator leaves them.

Virgil, already mounted on the monster Geryon, instructs the terrified narrator to climb on in front of him. Virgil positions himself between the narrator and the beast's venomous tail for protection. Overcoming his fear with shame, the narrator mounts Geryon. Virgil embraces him and commands the beast to begin a slow, wide-circling descent. Geryon pushes off the cliff backward like a small boat and begins to swim through the air down into the next circle.

The narrator describes his immense fear as Geryon descends into the Eighth Circle. He compares his terror to that of the mythological figures Phaethon and Icarus. He feels the wind and hears the roar of the infernal waterfall, and his fear increases as he begins to see the fires and hear the wails of the damned below. Geryon's descent is compared to a tired falcon returning to its master. Upon landing at the base of the cliff, the monster deposits the poets and vanishes as quickly as an arrow shot from a bow.

## Canto 18

The narrator describes the Eighth Circle, Malebolge: a vast, circular pit of iron-colored stone divided into ten concentric ditches. Stone bridges cross these ditches, leading to a central well. After being set down by Geryon, the poets turn left and observe the first ditch. Here, two lines of naked sinners (panderers and seducers) walk in opposite directions, constantly whipped from behind by horned demons. The narrator compares this two-way traffic to the crowd control on the bridge to St. Peter's during the Roman Jubilee of 1300.

The narrator recognizes a panderer, Venedico Caccianemico of Bologna, who confesses to having pimped his own sister. After a demon whips Venedico away, the poets climb a bridge over the ditch. From there, Virgil points out Jason, the great hero of Greek myth, punished here as a seducer for abandoning Hypsipyle and Medea.

The poets reach the second ditch of the Eighth Circle, where flatterers are immersed in human excrement. The narrator recognizes and speaks to a man named Alessio Interminei. Virgil then points out Thaïs, a prostitute from a classical play, as another example of a flatterer.

## Canto 19

The narrator and Virgil arrive at the third ditch of the Eighth Circle, where simonists (those who buy or sell church offices) are punished. The narrator delivers an invective against them. He describes the landscape: a stone floor filled with round holes. From each hole, the legs and feet of a sinner stick out, while the rest of their body is trapped inside. Their soles are on fire, causing them to twitch violently. The narrator notices one soul suffering more than the others and asks Virgil who it is. Virgil offers to take him closer to speak with the soul, and the narrator readily agrees. They then descend from the bridge into the ditch.

The narrator is carried by Virgil to the most tormented of the simonist popes. Addressing the upside-down soul, the narrator is mistaken for Pope Boniface VIII, whose damnation is expected. After clarifying his identity, the narrator learns he is speaking to Pope Nicholas III of the Orsini family. Nicholas explains his sin, identifies his predecessors below him, and prophesies the damnation of Boniface VIII and an even more corrupt pope, Clement V, who will come after Boniface and cover them both.

The narrator delivers a fiery condemnation of papal avarice and simony to Pope Nicholas III, accusing him of idolatry and lamenting the corrupting influence of the Donation of Constantine. The pope reacts by kicking his feet in rage or shame. Pleased with the narrator's righteous anger, Virgil embraces him, carries him back up to the bridge, and crosses over to the edge of the next ditch.

## Canto 20

The narrator enters the fourth ditch of the Eighth Circle and sees the souls of diviners and sorcerers. Their punishment is to have their heads twisted completely backward, forcing them to walk backward while their tears run down their backs. Overcome by the grotesque pity of the scene, the narrator cries, but Virgil sternly rebukes him, explaining that in Hell, true piety consists of accepting God's judgment without feeling human pity for the damned.

Virgil points out four famous diviners punished in this ditch: Amphiaraus, who was swallowed by the earth; Tiresias, who changed gender; Aruns, an Etruscan soothsayer; and Manto, a prophetess who wandered until she settled in the land where the narrator was born. Virgil asks the narrator to listen as he recounts her story.

Virgil continues the story of the prophetess Manto. He provides a detailed geographical description of northern Italy, tracing the river Mincio from its source at Lake Garda to a swampy area. He explains that Manto, fleeing human society, settled in this desolate place and died there. Later, men built a city over her bones, naming it Mantua in her honor. Virgil concludes by asserting this as the true origin of his homeland, correcting other historical accounts.

The narrator affirms his complete faith in Virgil's reasoning and asks his guide to identify other notable souls among the diviners. Virgil points out Eurypylus, an augur from the Trojan War; Michael Scot, a 13th-century astrologer; Guido Bonatti and Asdente, two other contemporary soothsayers; and a group of witches. Concluding his descriptions, Virgil notes the time—it is just before dawn—and reminds the narrator that the full moon had helped him the previous night, before urging him onward.

## Canto 21

The poets arrive at the fifth ditch of the Eighth Circle, where they see a river of boiling black pitch. The scene is described with a long simile comparing it to the Venetian Arsenal. As the narrator stares into the pitch, Virgil abruptly warns him of a black devil rushing toward them from behind. The demon carries a sinner slung over its shoulder, held brutally by the ankles, and is heading for the pitch.

A demon throws a corrupt official from Lucca into the boiling pitch, where other demons (the Malebranche) taunt him and force him under with hooks. Virgil instructs the narrator to hide, then steps forward to confront the swarm of demons that rush to attack him. He commands them to stop and listen to him before they use their hooks.

Virgil confronts the lead demon, Malacoda, and quells his aggression by invoking divine will. The narrator comes out of hiding, terrified by the menacing demons. Malacoda explains that the bridge over the next ditch is broken but offers an escort of his demons to guide the poets to another crossing point, giving a deceptively precise time for when the bridge collapsed.

Malacoda commands a troop of ten demons, led by Barbariccia, to escort the poets, falsely claiming another bridge is intact. A terrified narrator begs Virgil to refuse the escort, pointing to the demons' threatening gestures. Virgil reassures him that their malice is directed at the sinners, not them. The demons then signal their leader by pressing their tongues between their teeth, and he replies with an even cruder signal—a fart—to begin their march.

## Canto 22

Escorted by ten demons, the narrator reflects on the strange, crude signal that began their march, contrasting it with human military signals. He resigns himself to his company with a proverb. His attention is fixed on the ditch of boiling pitch, where the sinners, like dolphins or frogs, briefly surface to relieve their torment, only to dive back down immediately when the demon Barbariccia approaches.

A demon named Graffiacan hooks a sinner out of the boiling pitch. At the narrator's request, Virgil questions the soul, who identifies himself as Ciampolo from Navarre, a barrator (a corrupt official). As he tells his story, the other demons, Ciriatto and Libicocco, begin to torment and wound him. Ciampolo names other sinners in the pitch—friar Gomita and Michel Zanche—before another demon, Farfarello, threatens him, forcing their leader, Barbariccia, to intervene.

The sinner Ciampolo offers to trick his fellow sufferers into emerging from the pitch if the demons, the Malebranche, will withdraw. Cagnazzo suspects a trick, but Alichino, eager for some sport, takes the sinner up on the offer. As the demons turn away, Ciampolo seizes the moment and dives back into the pitch. An enraged Alichino gives chase but is too slow. Another demon, Calcabrina, furious at the ruse, attacks Alichino. The two demons brawl, fall into the boiling pitch, and get their wings stuck. As their leader Barbariccia dispatches a rescue party, the narrator and Virgil take the opportunity to slip away.

## Canto 23

Fearing the vengeful pursuit of the tricked demons (the Malebranche), the narrator alerts Virgil. Just as the demons appear, Virgil grabs the narrator and slides down the steep bank into the sixth ditch, like a mother saving her child from a fire. They escape just in time, as divine law prevents the demons from leaving their assigned post in the fifth ditch.

In the sixth ditch of the Eighth Circle, the narrator and Virgil find the hypocrites. They are punished by having to walk endlessly under the weight of magnificent gilded cloaks that are lined with heavy lead. Two of these souls, recognizing the narrator's Tuscan accent, call out to him. They identify themselves as Catalano and Loderingo, two "Jovial Friars" from Bologna who were appointed to keep peace in Florence but whose hypocrisy led to violence and ruin, and they explain their eternal, glittering torment.

The narrator's speech to the hypocrites is interrupted when he sees a soul crucified on the ground. The friar Catalano identifies this soul as Caiaphas, the high priest who advised crucifying Jesus for the good of the people. He is punished by being trampled by all the other hypocrites walking the path. Virgil marvels at this punishment and then asks the friar for a way out of the ditch. The friar explains that the stone bridge above them is broken, a casualty of the earthquake at Christ's death, but they can climb the ruin. Virgil realizes he was deceived by the demon Malacoda, who had claimed a bridge was intact. The friar confirms that the devil is known to be a liar. Angered by the deception, Virgil strides away, and the narrator follows him.

## Canto 24

The canto opens with a long simile comparing Virgil's fleeting anger to a peasant's brief despair over morning frost that he mistakes for snow. Reassured by Virgil's gentle expression, the narrator begins the arduous climb out of the sixth ditch. Virgil acts as a guide, planning their path up the steep ruins of the collapsed bridge and physically helping the narrator ascend. The climb is so difficult that the narrator, exhausted and out of breath, collapses upon reaching the top.

Virgil exhorts the exhausted narrator to cast off sloth, reminding him that fame is not won by resting and that a much longer journey awaits. Spurred on, the narrator claims to be renewed in strength, and they continue over the difficult, ruined bridge. As they cross, the narrator hears an angry, unintelligible voice from the seventh ditch below. Unable to see clearly, he asks Virgil to descend so they can investigate. Virgil agrees, stating that action is the best response to an honest request. They descend the bridge, and the next pouch (bolgia) becomes visible.

The narrator enters the seventh ditch of the Eighth Circle, a pit filled with a horrifying mass of serpents. Naked sinners, the thieves, run terrified among them, their hands bound by snakes. The narrator watches as one sinner is bitten, instantly incinerates into ash, and then immediately is restored to his human form from that same ash, like the mythical phoenix. The restored sinner is left bewildered and dazed, like someone recovering from an epileptic seizure, prompting the narrator to marvel at the severity of God's justice.

The restored sinner identifies himself as Vanni Fucci from Pistoia. Shamed at being recognized, he confesses his sin was stealing from a sacristy. In spiteful retaliation, he delivers a dark prophecy about the defeat of the narrator's political party, the White Guelphs, saying he tells him this news specifically to cause him pain.

## Canto 25

Vanni Fucci ends his prophecy with a blasphemous gesture toward God. Snakes immediately punish him for it, silencing and binding him. The narrator declares him the most arrogant soul he has seen, even more so than Capaneus. As Vanni flees, a monstrous, snake-covered centaur named Cacus arrives in a rage, hunting for him. Virgil explains that Cacus is punished here among the thieves for his fraudulent theft of Hercules' cattle, not with the other centaurs in the circle of the violent.

As the narrator and Virgil watch, three new sinners appear. A six-footed serpent, who is the thief Cianfa, attacks another named Agnello (Agnel). In a grotesque metamorphosis, the two figures melt into each other, blending their forms until they become a single, monstrous new creature that is neither man nor reptile. The other two thieves watch in horror as this new being, now "two and none," slowly walks away.

A small serpent attacks one of the two remaining thieves. The two figures, man and reptile, stare at each other as smoke pours from the man's wound and the serpent's mouth, mingling together. They then begin a grotesque, mutual transformation, exchanging forms. The narrator boasts that this metamorphosis surpasses any described by the classical poets Lucan and Ovid, as he depicts two natures exchanging their very substance. The man's legs fuse into a tail while the serpent's tail splits into legs. The man's arms retract as the serpent's forelimbs lengthen. The human skin becomes hard and scaly, while the serpent's becomes soft. Their faces reshape, and the man's tongue forks while the serpent's becomes whole, completing the transformation.

The thief who was transformed into a serpent mockingly addresses the one unchanged thief, Puccio Sciancato, telling him to watch the third companion, Buoso, crawl away as a reptile. The narrator apologizes for the inadequacy of his pen to describe such a strange event and confirms that, despite his confusion, he was able to identify the unchanged Puccio and alludes to the identity of the thief who became the attacking serpent.

## Canto 26

The narrator and Virgil enter the eighth ditch of the Eighth Circle. The narrator delivers a sarcastic invective against his native Florence, having seen five of its citizens among the thieves. In this new ditch, they see countless individual flames, each concealing a sinner. Virgil explains these are the fraudulent counselors. The narrator's attention is drawn to a twin-tipped flame, which Virgil identifies as containing Ulysses and Diomedes, punished for their deceptions during the Trojan War. At the narrator's request, Virgil addresses the flame, and the soul of Ulysses recounts his final, fatal voyage. Driven by a thirst for knowledge, he sailed past the Pillars of Hercules into the unknown ocean with his aging crew, exhorting them to seek experience. After five months, they sighted the Mountain of Purgatory but were sunk by a divine storm just before reaching it.

## Canto 27

After Ulysses departs, a new flame appears, making a muffled sound that slowly resolves into clear words. The soul within, having overheard Virgil's Lombard dialect, addresses the narrator. He asks to speak, despite his torment, and requests news about the political state of his home region, Romagna. Virgil then instructs the narrator to answer, noting that the soul is a fellow Italian.

The narrator provides the soul with a detailed political summary of the current state of Romagna, city by city, describing the various tyrants who rule them through heraldic imagery. He concludes by asking the soul to identify himself in return for the promise that his fame will be preserved on Earth.

The flame containing the soul speaks. Believing the narrator cannot return to the living world to report his story, the soul confesses his identity. He was Guido da Montefeltro, a cunning military strategist (more fox than lion) who, in his old age, became a Franciscan friar to atone for his sins. His repentance would have saved him, but a "great priest" (Pope Boniface VIII) coerced him back into his former sin of fraudulent counsel.

Guido da Montefeltro recounts how Pope Boniface VIII, whom he calls 'the prince of the new Pharisees,' coerced him into giving fraudulent advice for his war against the Colonna family. Boniface offered a preemptive absolution, but upon Guido's death, a demon claimed his soul, arguing with flawless logic that one cannot be absolved for a sin one has not yet repented of. This demon took Guido to Minos, who condemned him to the eighth circle. The flame then departs, and the poets move on toward the next ditch.

## Canto 28

The narrator enters the ninth ditch of the Eighth Circle, home to the sowers of discord. He struggles to describe the horrific sight of their mutilated bodies, which are continuously cleaved by a demon's sword. He meets the prophet Muhammad, who is split from his chin to his anus, and his son-in-law Ali, who is split down the face. Muhammad explains their punishment and, after Virgil clarifies the narrator's purpose, delivers a prophetic warning for the heretic Fra Dolcino before departing.

Another mutilated soul, Pier da Medicina, addresses the narrator. He identifies himself and delivers a prophecy concerning two men from Fano who will be murdered by the treacherous one-eyed tyrant of Rimini. When the narrator asks about a nearby soul who seems full of regret, Pier forces open the mouth of his companion, revealing the severed tongue of Curio, the Roman who spurred Caesar to cross the Rubicon and is now silenced for his divisive speech.

Another soul, Mosca de' Lamberti, whose hands have been chopped off, shouts out his identity and the infamous advice he gave which sowed discord in Florence. After he leaves, the narrator sees a sight so strange he hesitates to describe it: a headless body carrying its own severed head like a lantern. This is the troubadour poet Bertrand de Born, who explains his punishment is a fitting retribution—a 'contrapasso'—for having turned a king against his own father.

## Canto 29

As the narrator lingers, overwhelmed by the mutilated souls, Virgil urges him onward. The narrator explains he was looking for a kinsman. Virgil reveals that this relative, Geri del Bello, appeared briefly, threatening the narrator before departing. The narrator laments that Geri's disdain stems from his unavenged murder, a family shame that makes the narrator feel even more pity for him.

The narrator and Virgil arrive at the tenth and final ditch of Malebolge. The air is filled with a foul stench and sounds of lamentation from the souls of the falsifiers, who are afflicted with horrible diseases. The narrator compares the scene to plague-ridden lands and classical myths of pestilence. He observes the souls lying in heaps, unable to stand, and focuses on two who are frantically scratching their scabby skin with their fingernails.

Virgil addresses two of the afflicted souls, who are scratching themselves furiously. The souls identify themselves as Italians and are startled to see a living man. The narrator, encouraged by Virgil, asks who they are. One, an alchemist from Arezzo, explains that while he was executed for failing to fulfill a joking promise to teach a man from Siena how to fly, he is damned here in the final pouch of the Eighth Circle for the sin of alchemy.

The narrator jokes about the vanity of the Sienese people. The other afflicted soul, Capocchio, overhears and sarcastically agrees, listing several famously spendthrift Sienese figures. He then reveals his own identity, reminding the narrator of his past life as an alchemist, a skilled 'ape of nature.'

## Canto 30

The narrator describes the punishment for falsifiers of person. He illustrates their madness by comparing it to the mythological insanity of Athamas and Hecuba. Two of these souls, naked and rabid, run through the ditch. One, identified as Gianni Schicchi, bites and drags away the alchemist Capocchio. The other alchemist then identifies the second rabid soul as Myrrha, who impersonated another to commit incest with her father. He also explains Gianni Schicchi's crime: impersonating the dead Buoso Donati to write a will in his own favor. After the two mad souls pass, the narrator turns his attention to the other sinners.

The narrator sees a soul suffering from dropsy, whose bloated torso and gaunt face make him resemble a lute. This is Master Adam, a counterfeiter, who is tormented by an unquenchable thirst, intensified by the memory of the cool streams of his native Casentino. He explains that he was induced to counterfeit Florentine florins by the Counts of Romena and longs to see them punished. He laments that his disease renders him immobile. The narrator then asks about two nearby souls steaming with fever. Master Adam identifies them as falsifiers of words: Potiphar's wife, who falsely accused Joseph, and Sinon, the Greek who tricked the Trojans.

The quarrel between the counterfeiter Master Adam and the liar Sinon escalates. Sinon punches Master Adam's bloated stomach, which sounds like a drum, and Master Adam retaliates with a slap. They then trade vicious insults, mocking each other with the specifics of their respective punishments: Master Adam's thirst and bloating versus Sinon's burning fever and aching head.

Virgil rebukes the narrator for being engrossed in the vulgar quarrel between Master Adam and Sinon. Overcome with shame, the narrator is rendered speechless. Virgil quickly reassures him, explaining that his fault was minor and has been more than cleansed by his shame. He warns the narrator that to enjoy such base disputes is an unworthy desire and reminds him that he, Virgil, will always be by his side to guide him.

## Canto 31

The narrator reflects on Virgil's comforting words, comparing them to the healing lance of Achilles. As they leave the final ditch of the Eighth Circle, an incredibly loud horn blast sounds. In the dim light, the narrator mistakes what he sees for a city of tall towers, but Virgil corrects him, explaining they are giants standing in the central pit of Hell. As they draw closer, the narrator's error gives way to fear as he sees the massive forms of the giants looming over the edge like the towers of the fortress of Monteriggioni.

The narrator sees the giant Nimrod, whose face is as large as a famous Roman sculpture. Nimrod shouts incomprehensible words, and Virgil explains he is the builder of the Tower of Babel, now unable to communicate. Virgil rebukes him, and they move on, finding the second, even larger giant, Ephialtes, bound in chains for his rebellion against the gods during the Gigantomachy.

The narrator asks to see the giant Briareus, but Virgil says they will instead meet Antaeus, who is unbound and can help them. After Ephialtes thrashes in his chains, terrifying the narrator, they approach Antaeus. Virgil persuades the giant to help them by praising his past deeds and promising that the narrator, a living man, will restore his fame on earth. Antaeus agrees, picks up the two poets, and gently lowers them into the Ninth Circle, the bottom of Hell.

## Canto 32

The narrator, invoking the Muses for help in describing the bottom of Hell, finds himself on a vast frozen lake, Cocytus. He is warned not to tread on the heads of the sinners trapped in the ice up to their necks. These souls, the traitors, are punished by the extreme cold, their teeth chattering and their faces bowed in misery.

The narrator encounters two souls frozen so tightly together that their hair is mingled. When he addresses them, their tears freeze, locking their eyes and binding their faces, and they butt heads in rage. Another soul, Camiscion de' Pazzi, identifies them as the traitorous Alberti brothers and points out other traitors to kin, prophesying that his relative Carlino's greater sin will soon arrive and make his own seem less severe. The sight fills the narrator with a lasting horror of the frozen lake.

While walking across the frozen lake of Cocytus, the narrator accidentally kicks a sinner in the head. The soul, a traitor from the Battle of Montaperti, angrily curses him. The narrator tries to force the soul to reveal his name, even tearing out his hair, but he refuses. Another damned soul nearby shouts out the first one's name: Bocca. Having confirmed his identity, the narrator vows to report Bocca's shame back in the world. In revenge, Bocca then identifies several other traitors to their country who are frozen nearby.

The narrator encounters two souls frozen in the same hole, with one gnawing on the back of the other's head. He compares this horrific act to the classical story of Tydeus and Menalippus. Addressing the cannibalistic sinner, the narrator offers to preserve his story on Earth if he explains the reason for his bestial hatred.

## Canto 33

Count Ugolino, the sinner gnawing on another's head, pauses to tell his story. He identifies himself and his victim, Archbishop Ruggieri. He explains that while the narrator may know Ruggieri betrayed him, he cannot know the cruelty of his death. Ugolino then begins to recount a prophetic dream he had in prison, where he and his sons (the wolf and whelps) were hunted down by Ruggieri (the master huntsman) and his allies.

Count Ugolino continues his story, recounting the horrific events in the Tower of Hunger. He awakens from his dream to hear his children crying for bread. He then hears the door to the tower being nailed shut, and he remains stonily silent as his children weep. In a fit of grief, he bites his own hands; his sons, thinking he is hungry, offer their own flesh for him to eat. Ugolino describes how he watched them die one by one over several days. Finally, blind with grief or starvation, he gropes over their dead bodies before, as he cryptically states, hunger's power overcame his grief.

After finishing his story, Count Ugolino resumes gnawing on Archbishop Ruggieri's skull. The narrator then delivers a fierce invective against the city of Pisa for its cruelty toward Ugolino's innocent children. The poets move on to the next region of the frozen lake, Ptolemea, where the traitors to guests lie on their backs. Here, their tears freeze in their eye sockets, preventing further weeping and intensifying their internal anguish. The narrator, though his face is numb from the cold, feels a wind and asks Virgil its cause. Virgil tells him he will soon see the source of the wind for himself.

A soul, Friar Alberigo, begs the narrator to clear the frozen tears from his eyes. Dante makes a conditional promise to do so if the soul identifies himself. Alberigo reveals the unique punishment of this circle, Ptolemea: a traitor's soul can be damned while their body, possessed by a demon, still lives on Earth. He points to another such soul, Branca Doria. Hearing this, the narrator breaks his promise, considering cruelty to the damned a form of righteous courtesy. The canto concludes with a fierce invective against the Genoese.

## Canto 34

Virgil announces the approach of Lucifer, the "king of Hell," who appears like a windmill through a dark, windy mist. They are in Judecca, the final zone of Cocytus, where the souls of traitors to their benefactors are completely frozen in the ice. Virgil reveals the full form of Lucifer (Dis), a creature who was once beautiful, and the narrator is struck with a fear so profound it leaves him in a state between life and death, which he declares is impossible to describe in words.

This segment provides the full description of Lucifer, the "emperor of the sorrowful kingdom," who is frozen from the waist up in the central ice of Cocytus. The narrator details his immense size and his monstrous, three-faced head (one red, one whitish-yellow, and one black). Under each face are huge, featherless, bat-like wings whose flapping creates the three winds that freeze all of Hell's final circle. From his six eyes, Lucifer weeps bloody tears, and in each of his three mouths, he chews on a sinner. Virgil identifies these ultimate traitors: Judas Iscariot in the central mouth, suffering the most pain, with Brutus and Cassius in the side mouths.

Virgil announces it's time to leave Hell. The narrator clings to Virgil's neck, and Virgil climbs down Lucifer's hairy body. At the hip joint, the center of the earth, Virgil flips himself and the narrator over and begins climbing "up" Lucifer's legs. They emerge through a rock opening into a new space. Confused, the narrator looks back, expecting to see Lucifer's head but instead sees his legs sticking up. He marvels at having passed the center of all gravity and challenges the reader to understand this cosmic shift.

Virgil explains their new position: having passed the center of the earth, they are in the Southern Hemisphere, where it is morning. He describes how Lucifer's fall created both the cavern of Hell and, on the opposite side of the world, the Mount of Purgatory. Following a hidden path carved by a small stream, the two poets climb upward, finally emerging through an opening to see the stars again.
