## Canto 1

Having emerged from Hell, the narrator launches his poem into the new subject of Purgatory, the realm of cleansing and hope. He invokes the Muses, especially Calliope, for inspiration. He describes the beautiful, serene dawn sky and the morning star Venus, a stark contrast to the darkness he has left. Turning south, he beholds four stars, symbolizing the cardinal virtues, which have not been seen by humanity since Adam and Eve were expelled from the Earthly Paradise.

Having emerged onto the shores of Purgatory, the narrator and Virgil are confronted by a dignified old man, Cato of Utica, the guardian of this realm. Cato challenges them, assuming they are damned souls who have escaped from Hell. Virgil explains their divinely sanctioned mission, clarifying that the narrator is alive and seeking spiritual liberty. He appeals to Cato's own famous love for political liberty, for which he died, and invokes the name of Cato's wife, Marcia, who resides in Limbo with Virgil, asking for passage through the seven realms of Purgatory.

Cato responds to Virgil's appeal. He states that while Marcia was dear to him in life, the law of the afterlife now prevents her from influencing him. However, since a heavenly lady has sent them, he grants them passage. He instructs Virgil to cleanse the narrator of the filth of Hell by washing his face and girding him with a humble reed found on the shore, as a prerequisite to meeting the angelic guardian of Purgatory. He also tells them the sun will guide their ascent.

Following Cato's instructions, Virgil and the narrator walk down to the shore of Purgatory. As dawn breaks, Virgil uses the dew on the grass to wash the grime of Hell from the narrator's face. He then girds the narrator with a humble reed. As soon as the reed is plucked, another miraculously grows in its place, symbolizing the inexhaustible nature of humility.

## Canto 2

At sunrise on the shore of Purgatory, the narrator and Virgil see a light approaching swiftly over the sea. It is an angel piloting a boat carrying over a hundred newly arrived souls. The angel is powered by his own wings and glows with blinding light. The souls sing Psalm 114, "When Israel went out of Egypt." After the angel makes the sign of the cross over them, they disembark, and he departs as quickly as he came.

The newly arrived souls on the shore of Purgatory, bewildered by their surroundings, ask the narrator and Virgil for the way up the mountain. Virgil explains they too are newcomers, having arrived by a much harder path (Hell). The souls then realize the narrator is alive because he breathes, and they gather around him in amazement, like people crowding a messenger with news, forgetting their primary purpose of beginning their purification.

Dante recognizes a soul as his friend, the musician Casella. After trying and failing to embrace the incorporeal shade, Dante learns why Casella's arrival was delayed and asks him to sing a song to soothe his weary soul. Casella obliges, singing one of Dante's own poems so beautifully that everyone present, including Virgil, stops to listen, captivated.

Cato interrupts Casella's song, scolding the newly arrived souls for delaying their purification. Like startled doves, the souls scatter and run toward the mountain, and Dante and Virgil quickly follow.

## Canto 3

After Cato's rebuke, the souls scatter toward the mountain. Dante, seeing his own shadow but not Virgil's, fears he has been abandoned. Virgil explains that as a spirit, he is incorporeal, though his physical body is buried in Naples. He then launches into a discourse on the limits of human reason, warning against trying to comprehend divine mysteries like the Trinity or how shades can feel torment. He sorrowfully cites the great pagan philosophers, including himself, whose unfulfilled desire for divine knowledge is now their eternal grief.

Dante and Virgil arrive at the base of the Mount of Purgatory and find it impossibly steep. While Virgil considers how to ascend, Dante spots a slow-moving group of souls. They approach these souls—the excommunicated who repented at the last moment—and Virgil asks for the way up. The souls, behaving like a timid flock of sheep, are startled when they see Dante's shadow, realizing he is alive. Virgil explains their divinely sanctioned journey, and the souls gesture for them to proceed ahead.

One of the souls, who is blond and handsome but marked by battle wounds, asks the narrator if he recognizes him. He then reveals himself to be Manfred, King of Sicily. He explains that despite his grievous sins and excommunication by the Pope, he repented at the moment of death and was saved by God's infinite mercy. He recounts how the Archbishop of Cosenza had his bones exhumed and scattered. He then explains the rule of Ante-Purgatory: the excommunicated must wait thirty times the length of their period of defiance before beginning their ascent, unless this time is shortened by the prayers of the living. He begs the narrator to go to his daughter, Constance, and tell her the truth of his salvation and his current state, so that her prayers might help him.

## Canto 4

The narrator explains how the soul's total absorption in a single experience makes it lose all sense of time, which is why he was unaware that over three hours had passed while listening to Manfred. When the souls point out the path, it is a fissure so narrow and steep that the narrator says climbing it is like flying with the wings of great desire. The poets begin the difficult ascent, using both their hands and feet.

After a difficult climb, Dante is exhausted. Virgil encourages him to reach a nearby ledge. They sit and rest, facing east toward where they began their ascent. Dante is surprised to notice the sun is on his left, a sign that they are in the Southern Hemisphere.

Virgil gives Dante a complex astronomical lesson to explain why the sun is in the north in the Southern Hemisphere, using the antipodal relationship between Jerusalem and Purgatory as a model. Dante understands and then asks how much further they must climb. Virgil explains that the ascent is hardest at the start and becomes progressively easier, and that Dante will know he has reached the next stage when the climb feels effortless.

As Virgil finishes explaining the mechanics of the mountain's ascent, a lazy voice from a nearby boulder interrupts them. The voice belongs to Belacqua, a friend of the narrator's from Florence, known for his indolence. He and other late-repentant souls are waiting in the shade. Belacqua explains they must wait a lifetime outside Purgatory's gate before they can begin their penance, a sentence that can only be shortened by the prayers of the living who are in a state of grace. Virgil then urges the narrator to move on, noting that it is now noon.

## Canto 5

As the narrator follows Virgil, a new group of souls notices his shadow, realizing he is alive. Virgil chides the narrator for being distracted, urging him to remain focused like a tower against the wind. The souls, who had been singing the 'Miserere,' send two messengers to inquire about the travelers. Virgil confirms the narrator is flesh and blood and tells the messengers that honoring him may benefit their group. The entire crowd of souls then rushes toward them, and Virgil advises the narrator to keep walking while listening to their pleas.

The souls of the late-repentant who died violently plead with the narrator to stop, explaining that they all repented at the last moment. The narrator, unable to recognize anyone, offers to help. One soul, Jacopo del Cassero, asks for prayers in his hometown of Fano and recounts his murder near Padua, describing how he was ambushed, fled into a marsh, became entangled, and bled to death.

Another soul, Bonconte da Montefeltro, tells the narrator his story. He explains that although he died at the Battle of Campaldino and his body was never found, he was saved by a single tear of repentance shed in the name of Mary. A demon from Hell, enraged at losing the soul, took revenge on the body by summoning a great storm. The storm created a flood that washed Bonconte's corpse into the Arno river, burying it and preventing a proper funeral.

A third soul, Pia de' Tolomei, asks the narrator to remember her when he returns to Earth. She poignantly summarizes her life and death—'Siena made me, Maremma unmade me'—and alludes to the fact that her husband, who gave her her wedding ring, knows the truth of her demise.

## Canto 6

The narrator, like a lucky winner in a dice game, is besieged by the souls of the late-repentant who died violently. He frees himself by promising to carry their requests for prayers back to the world. He then names several of these souls, including victims of political feuds and personal vendettas like Benincasa, Federigo Novello, Count Orso, and Pier da la Broccia, ending with a warning to Pier's accuser, who is still alive.

Dante asks Virgil to resolve an apparent contradiction: Virgil's own writings in the *Aeneid* seem to suggest that prayers cannot change divine decrees, yet the souls in Purgatory beg for prayers to shorten their sentences. Virgil explains that his pagan context was different, as their prayers were disconnected from God. He clarifies that in Christianity, prayer (a 'fire of love') can satisfy divine justice without compromising it. For a full resolution of this high theological doubt, however, Virgil tells Dante he must wait for Beatrice, whom he will meet, smiling and happy, at the top of the mountain.

Feeling re-energized, the narrator urges Virgil to climb faster, noting the mountain is already casting a shadow. Virgil explains they cannot reach the top before sunset. He then spots a solitary, dignified soul whom they approach for directions. This soul, silent and proud like a resting lion, ignores their questions until Virgil mentions he is from Mantua. At the name of their shared homeland, the soul reveals himself to be the poet Sordello and rushes to embrace Virgil.

Sparked by the patriotic embrace between Virgil and Sordello, the narrator launches into a famous, sorrowful invective against the state of Italy. He laments its servitude, internal strife, and lack of imperial leadership, comparing it to a ship without a pilot and a brothel. He rebukes the Church for usurping temporal power and castigates the Holy Roman Emperor, Albert I, for neglecting his duty to Italy. He lists warring families and suffering cities, begging Albert to come and see the chaos. The narrator concludes by questioning whether God has abandoned Italy or if this suffering is part of an inscrutable divine plan, observing that every city is full of tyrants.

The narrator concludes the canto with a bitter, sarcastic invective against his native Florence. He ironically praises its citizens for their eagerness to talk about justice and hold office, while mocking the city's supposed wealth, peace, and wisdom. He condemns its chronic political instability, comparing its flimsy, short-lived laws unfavorably to those of ancient Athens and Sparta, and concludes with a powerful image of Florence as a sick woman, restlessly tossing and turning, unable to find comfort or a cure.

## Canto 7

After Virgil reveals his identity, an awestruck Sordello embraces him humbly, hailing him as the 'glory of the Latins.' Sordello asks how he came to be there. Virgil explains that he has traveled through all of Hell, sent by heavenly power. He clarifies that his damnation is not for any active sin but for the sin of omission—lacking Christian faith. He describes Limbo, where he resides with other virtuous pagans and unbaptized infants, a place of sighs but not torments. Virgil then asks Sordello for the quickest way to the gate where Purgatory proper begins.

Sordello explains that ascent in Purgatory is only possible during the day. He demonstrates this by drawing a line on the ground, explaining that the darkness itself, not an external force, removes the power to climb. He suggests they find a resting place, pointing out a nearby valley where they can wait for dawn. Virgil agrees, and Sordello leads them toward this hollow in the mountainside.

Sordello leads the poets to a beautiful valley hollowed out of the mountainside. The colors of the grass and flowers are so vibrant they would surpass any earthly pigment, and a thousand sweet smells blend into one complex fragrance. Here, souls sit singing the 'Salve, Regina'. Sordello advises that before they descend, they should observe the souls from their current vantage point on the ledge, as their features will be clearer from above.

Sordello, from a high ledge, points out and identifies several late-repentant European rulers resting in the valley below. He describes Emperor Rudolf I, Ottokar II of Bohemia, Philip III of France, Henry I of Navarre, Peter III of Aragon, and Charles I of Anjou, commenting on their failures and the shortcomings of their descendants. He also identifies Henry III of England and William VII of Montferrat, reflecting on how virtue is rarely passed down through lineage.

## Canto 8

At twilight in the Valley of the Rulers, a soul leads the others in singing the evening hymn 'Te lucis ante.' Dante signals to the reader that an allegory is about to unfold. Two green-clad angels with broken swords descend from Heaven and take up positions on either side of the valley. Sordello explains they have come from the Virgin Mary to guard the souls against a serpent that will soon appear. Terrified, the narrator presses close to Virgil.

Dante and Virgil descend into the Valley of the Rulers. There, the narrator is recognized by Nino Visconti, a judge from Gallura. Nino expresses joy that Dante is not damned and is startled to learn he is alive. He asks Dante to tell his daughter Giovanna to pray for him, and then bitterly laments his widow's remarriage, prophesying that her new family (the Visconti of Milan) will not honor her as his own (the rooster of Gallura) would have.

As the narrator observes the night sky, he notes three new stars (the theological virtues). As Virgil explains their significance, Sordello interrupts to point out a serpent—the symbol of temptation—entering the valley. The two guardian angels immediately swoop down, frightening the serpent away with the sound of their wings before returning to their posts.

A soul who had been with Nino Visconti addresses Dante. He introduces himself as Currado Malaspina and asks for news of his homeland. Dante, despite never having visited, praises the Malaspina family's widespread fame for generosity and valor, noting their unique virtue in a corrupt world. In return, Currado prophesies that Dante will personally experience this hospitality within seven years, a prediction of Dante's future exile.

## Canto 9

The segment opens with a poetic description of the time, just before dawn. Overcome by his mortal need for rest, the narrator falls asleep in the Valley of the Rulers. He has a prophetic dream in which he is on Mount Ida and a golden eagle swoops down, snatches him, and carries him up to the sphere of fire, where the heat becomes so intense that it wakes him.

The narrator awakens disoriented and terrified, having been mysteriously transported from the Valley of the Rulers. Virgil calms him, explaining that while he slept, Saint Lucia carried him up to the very gate of Purgatory proper. Reassured and comforted by this revelation of divine aid, the narrator's fear turns to resolve, and the two poets proceed toward the entrance.

The narrator addresses the reader, signaling the elevated subject matter to come. He and Virgil approach the gate of Purgatory, which has three distinct steps. An angelic gatekeeper, whose face is too bright to look at and who holds a gleaming sword, challenges them. After Virgil explains they were sent by Saint Lucia, the angel allows them to approach. The narrator then describes the three allegorical steps: the first is a white marble mirror (Confession), the second a dark, cracked stone (Contrition), and the third a blood-red porphyry (Satisfaction). The angel sits upon the top step, on a threshold of diamond.

The angel guarding the gate of Purgatory inscribes seven 'P's (for the seven deadly sins) on the narrator's forehead with his sword. He then uses two keys, one silver and one gold, to open the sacred gate, warning the narrator not to look back. As the gate opens with a thunderous noise, the narrator hears the 'Te Deum' being sung from within, the words sometimes obscured by the sound, like a choir singing with an organ.

## Canto 10

After passing through the Gate of Purgatory, which slams shut behind them, the narrator and Virgil ascend a narrow, zig-zagging path. The difficult climb takes them a long time, but they eventually emerge onto a level, deserted terrace, the first of Purgatory proper. Exhausted, they pause to observe their new surroundings.

On the first terrace of Purgatory, reserved for the proud, the narrator and Virgil encounter a series of divinely crafted marble reliefs that serve as examples of humility. The narrator examines three scenes in detail: the Annunciation to the Virgin Mary; King David dancing humbly before the Ark of the Covenant, to the scorn of his wife Michal; and the Roman Emperor Trajan, who pauses his military departure to grant justice to a poor widow. The art is described as a form of 'visible speech,' so realistic it seems to live and breathe.

Virgil points out a group of souls moving slowly, who will direct them. These are the proud, who are crushed to the ground under the weight of heavy stones, making them difficult to recognize. In a direct address, the narrator scolds proud humanity for being like 'worms' that fail to become the 'angelic butterfly' (the perfected soul). He compares the hunched-over posture of the sinners to that of a carved figure used as a corbel, bent double under a great weight. The suffering is so intense that even the most patient among them seems to cry, 'I can no more.'

## Canto 11

The souls of the proud recite a version of the Lord's Prayer, adapted to their state of purgation. They pray for themselves and for the living. The narrator then reflects on their burden and on the mutual need for prayer between those on Earth and those in Purgatory, urging the living to help these souls ascend to Heaven.

Virgil, on behalf of Dante, politely asks the souls of the proud for the easiest path up the mountain, explaining that Dante's living body makes the climb difficult. A voice from among the burdened souls directs them to the right. The soul, revealing himself as Omberto Aldobrandeschi, explains that the stone he carries prevents him from looking up to identify Dante. He confesses he is being punished for his arrogance, born of his noble Tuscan lineage, a sin which brought ruin not only to himself but to his whole family.

While listening to the soul of Omberto, the narrator is recognized by another soul, the manuscript illuminator Oderisi of Gubbio. Oderisi, now humbled, admits a rival artist surpassed him and delivers a powerful speech on the vanity of earthly fame. He gives examples from art (Giotto eclipsing Cimabue) and poetry (one Guido eclipsing another), predicting that a third poet may eclipse them both. He argues that fame is as fleeting as the wind or the color of grass, pointing to the once-mighty Sienese leader Provenzan Salvani, now barely a whisper, as proof.

Dante asks Oderisi to identify the soul he just mentioned, Provenzan Salvani. Dante then questions how Provenzan, a late repentant, was allowed to bypass the waiting period in Ante-Purgatory. Oderisi explains that Provenzan performed a profound act of humility by publicly begging in the Campo di Siena to raise ransom money for a friend. This act earned him passage. Oderisi then darkly prophesies that Dante's own future exile will teach him the meaning of such humiliation.

## Canto 12

The narrator walks bent over with a burdened soul until Virgil tells him to straighten up and continue their journey. Virgil then instructs him to look down at the pathway, where he sees examples of punished pride carved into the stone, much like figures are carved on tombstones, but of far greater artistry.

Dante describes the intricate carvings on the pavement of the first terrace of Purgatory, which depict thirteen examples of punished pride from biblical, classical, and mythological sources. These images, from the fall of Lucifer to the destruction of Troy, are so lifelike that Dante marvels at the divine artistry. He concludes with a sarcastic exhortation for humanity to continue in its pride and ignore the evidence of its own 'evil path'.

Virgil urges the narrator, who has been engrossed in observing the carvings on the pavement, to move on, noting that it is noon. He points out an angel, the guardian of the exit from the first terrace, who is approaching them. The angel, shining like the morning star, welcomes them but laments how few humans accept the call to ascend. He then leads them to the steps carved into the rock, erases the 'P' for Pride from the narrator's forehead with a beat of his wing, and promises them a safe passage upward.

The poets ascend a steep stairway, which the narrator compares to a real one in Florence. They hear the Beatitude for the humble, and the narrator, feeling suddenly lighter, asks Virgil why. Virgil explains that one of the seven 'P's has been erased from his forehead and that the climb will become easier as the others are removed. Realizing this, the narrator reaches up and discovers only six 'P's remain, prompting a smile from Virgil.

## Canto 13

The poets arrive at the second terrace of Purgatory, for the envious. The terrace is bare and made of livid stone. Lacking a visible path or souls to ask, Virgil decides to follow the sun. As they walk, they hear invisible spirits flying by, shouting examples of charity—the opposite of envy—which serve as the 'whip' to spur the souls to penance.

Virgil directs the narrator's attention to a group of souls sitting along the stone bank. These are the envious, punished by having their eyelids sewn shut with iron wire. Clad in stone-colored cloaks and leaning on each other for support, they pray for intercession. Moved to pity, and feeling it an offense to observe them unseen, the narrator gets Virgil's permission to speak. He then addresses the souls, asking if any among them are Italian.

A soul answers the narrator, identifying herself as Sapia of Siena, a woman whose name meant 'wise' but who lived foolishly. She confesses her sin of envy, recounting how she rejoiced at the defeat of her own countrymen at the Battle of Colle. She explains that she only repented at the end of her life and that her time in Ante-Purgatory was shortened by the prayers of a holy man named Pier Pettinaio. Noticing that the narrator is alive, she asks who he is. He admits his own guilt of envy but states his fear of the punishment for pride (the terrace below) is far greater. Sapia, astonished by his living presence, asks him to restore her good name in Tuscany and ends with a bitter jab at the vanity of her fellow Sienese for their futile civic projects.

## Canto 14

Two souls of the envious, leaning on each other with their eyes sewn shut, notice the narrator's presence. Amazed that he is alive and can open and close his eyes, they ask him who he is and where he comes from. The narrator responds by describing the river Arno without naming it, explaining he comes from its valley but is not yet famous. One soul correctly guesses the river is the Arno, and the other asks why the narrator hid its name, as if it were something horrible.

One of the souls of the envious, Guido del Duca, answers his companion's question with a bitter invective against the inhabitants of the Arno valley. He describes them as progressively more vicious beasts—pigs, curs, wolves, and foxes—as the river flows from its source toward the sea. He then delivers a grim prophecy about the cruelty of his companion's grandson, Fulcieri da Calboli, who will savagely punish the Florentine 'wolves.' The companion, Rinieri da Calboli, is visibly distraught upon hearing this.

Dante asks the two souls their names. Guido del Duca responds, identifying himself and his companion Rinieri da Calboli. He then launches into a long, sorrowful lament for the decline of virtue in their homeland of Romagna, listing by name the noble families and individuals of a bygone era of chivalry and courtesy. He contrasts this with the current corrupt state of the region and ends by telling Dante to leave, as the subject has caused him too much grief.

After the souls of Guido del Duca and Rinieri fall silent, the poets continue walking. They hear two disembodied voices, examples of punished envy (Cain and Aglauros), which frighten the narrator. Virgil explains these are the 'bridles' meant to restrain humanity, and then rebukes mankind for ignoring the call of Heaven to focus on earthly things, thus earning divine punishment.

## Canto 15

The poets, walking west into the setting sun, are blinded by a light brighter than the sun. It is the Angel of Mercy, who invites them to ascend to the next terrace. As they climb the less-steep stairs, the Beatitude "Blessed are the merciful" is sung, and the narrator is encouraged with a cry of "Rejoice, you who overcome!".

Dante asks Virgil to explain the nature of envy, which arises from desiring earthly goods that are diminished when shared. Virgil explains that heavenly good, in contrast, is infinite and increases the more it is shared among souls, like light reflected between mirrors. When Dante is still confused, Virgil states that his human reason can only take the explanation so far and that Beatrice will provide the full, divine understanding. He ends by encouraging Dante to continue his penitential journey to erase the remaining five 'P's from his forehead.

Upon reaching the third terrace, for the wrathful, the narrator is immediately drawn into three ecstatic visions of meekness: Mary's gentle rebuke of the young Jesus in the temple, the Athenian ruler Pisistratus's calm refusal to seek revenge, and Saint Stephen's forgiveness of his murderers as he is stoned to death.

The narrator "wakes up" from his ecstatic visions. Virgil, who already knows what the narrator saw, explains that the visions were meant to open his heart to peace. Virgil's question ("What is wrong?") was not one of ignorance but a deliberate prompt to restore strength to the narrator's steps, just as one must spur on the lazy.

As the narrator and Virgil walk on the third terrace at dusk, a thick, dark smoke, which is the punishment for the wrathful, rolls toward them, blinding them and fouling the pure air.

## Canto 16

Blinded by the thick smoke of the third terrace, the narrator follows Virgil, who offers his shoulder for guidance. They hear the souls of the wrathful singing the 'Agnus Dei'. One soul, Marco the Lombard, speaks to the narrator, marveling at his living presence. The narrator explains his journey, and in return, Marco confirms they are on the right path and asks for prayers.

The narrator asks Marco the Lombard to explain the cause of the world's corruption: is it fate (the heavens) or human choice? Marco sighs, then explains that while the heavens provide initial impulses, humanity possesses free will and the light of reason to overcome them. The ultimate cause of the world's ills lies within humanity itself, not in the stars.

Marco the Lombard explains that the soul, created simple by God, is naturally drawn to pleasure and requires law (the Emperor) and spiritual guidance (the Pope) to direct it. He argues that the world's corruption stems from the Church's usurpation of temporal power, extinguishing the imperial 'sun' and mixing the sword with the shepherd's staff. He laments the loss of virtue in Lombardy, naming three old men as the last remnants of a better age. After Dante expresses his understanding, Marco identifies one of the men, Gherardo, before departing abruptly as an angel's light pierces the smoke.

## Canto 17

Emerging from the blinding smoke of the third terrace, the narrator is immediately plunged into a series of ecstatic visions. These divinely sent visions are examples of punished wrath, showing the mythological story of Progne, the biblical hanging of Haman, and the suicide of Queen Amata from the Aeneid.

The narrator is awakened from his visions of punished wrath by a brilliant angelic light. The angel, who is the guardian of the third terrace, invites the poets to ascend to the next level. As the narrator climbs, the angel erases the 'P' for wrath from his forehead, and he hears the Beatitude for the peacemakers. As dusk falls and the stars appear, the narrator feels his strength drain away, and he can no longer climb.

Halted by nightfall on the fourth terrace of Purgatory, the narrator asks Virgil what sin is purged there. Virgil identifies it as sloth—a deficient love of the good—and begins a major discourse on the nature of love, explaining it as the root ('seed') of every virtue and every sin.

Virgil continues his explanation of love as the root of all actions. He explains that since one cannot hate oneself or God, all sinful love must be directed at one's neighbor (perverted love) or be a flawed love for the good. He outlines the three forms of perverted love—pride, envy, and wrath—which are punished on the lower terraces. He then introduces deficient love (sloth), punished on this terrace, and hints at the three forms of excessive love punished on the terraces above, which he leaves for the narrator to discover.

## Canto 18

Dante asks Virgil to explain the nature of love. Virgil describes love as a natural, neutral inclination toward a pleasing object. When Dante questions how there can be moral responsibility if love is an external response, Virgil explains that humans possess an innate faculty of reason (free will) that has the power to accept or reject these loves, and this is the source of all merit and blame. He concludes that Beatrice will provide the full, faith-based explanation.

After Virgil's discourse, a drowsy Dante is startled by the souls of the slothful, who run past them in a great crowd. Two souls shout examples of zeal (Mary and Caesar). Virgil asks them for the way up. One soul, the former abbot of San Zeno in Verona, answers without stopping, prophesying ill for the one who appointed his deformed son to rule the monastery. As they run past, Virgil points out two final souls shouting examples of punished sloth.

The souls of the slothful shout examples of their sin's consequences—the Israelites who died before reaching the Promised Land and the Trojans who abandoned Aeneas. After they disappear, the narrator's mind begins to wander from thought to thought until, overwhelmed, he closes his eyes and falls asleep, his thoughts turning into a dream.

## Canto 19

In a dream just before dawn, the narrator sees a grotesque, stammering woman. His gaze transforms her into a beautiful, singing Siren who boasts of her power to lead men astray, even Ulysses. A holy lady appears and commands Virgil to act. Virgil rips open the Siren's clothes, revealing a foul belly whose stench awakens the horrified narrator. The dream allegorizes the deceptive allure of the sins of excessive love (avarice, gluttony, lust) which are punished on the upper terraces.

After waking from his disturbing dream of the Siren, the narrator is urged onward by Virgil. An angel, representing the Beatitude for those who mourn, ushers them up to the fifth terrace, for the avaricious and prodigal. Still troubled by the vision, the narrator is told by Virgil to let it suffice as a lesson about the sins ahead and to instead look upward to the 'lure' of Heaven. Inspired by this, the narrator feels renewed, like a falcon answering its master's call, and continues the ascent.

Upon entering the fifth terrace for the avaricious and prodigal, the narrator sees souls lying face down, weeping. Virgil asks for directions and is told to keep to the outer edge. The narrator, with Virgil's permission, addresses one soul, asking his identity and why they are punished in this way, and offering to secure prayers for him on Earth.

The soul identifies himself as Pope Adrian V. He confesses that his late conversion was prompted by the heavy, unfulfilling burden of the papacy. He explains that the avaricious are punished by being bound face down, a fitting retribution for their focus on earthly things. When the narrator kneels in reverence, Adrian tells him to stand, explaining that earthly ranks are void in the afterlife. He asks the narrator to leave and to tell his virtuous niece Alagia of his fate so she may pray for him.

## Canto 20

Dante reluctantly leaves Pope Adrian V and continues along the terrace of the avaricious. He launches into an invective against the "she-wolf" of avarice, questioning when a savior will come to banish her. He then hears a soul reciting examples of poverty and generosity (Mary, Fabricius, and Saint Nicholas). Intrigued, Dante approaches this soul and asks for his identity, promising to carry his story back to the world.

The soul identifies himself as Hugh Capet, founder of the French royal dynasty. He confesses he is the "root of the evil plant" whose descendants have plagued Christendom through their avarice. He then launches into a long prophecy and denunciation of his lineage's crimes, including the actions of Charles of Anjou, Charles of Valois, and Philip the Fair, culminating in the attack on Pope Boniface VIII at Anagni. He concludes by explaining the penance of the avaricious: during the day they recite examples of poverty and generosity, and at night they shout out examples of punished avarice.

As Dante and Virgil leave Hugh Capet, the entire mountain of Purgatory trembles violently, terrifying the narrator. Immediately following the tremor, all the souls on the mountain cry out in unison, "Gloria in excelsis Deo." The poets stand motionless and in suspense, like the shepherds at the Nativity, until the event concludes. They resume their path, but the narrator is consumed with a desperate yet unspoken curiosity about what he has just witnessed, proceeding onward in timid and pensive silence.

## Canto 21

Dante is tormented by his desire to know the cause of the recent earthquake. As he follows Virgil, a new soul appears behind them, like Christ appearing to the disciples on the road to Emmaus. The soul greets them, and Virgil explains their unusual status: he is a damned guide, and Dante is a living man whose journey is divinely willed. Virgil then asks the new soul the very question Dante longed to ask: why did the mountain tremble and all the souls cry out? This question brings Dante immense relief, as he hopes his curiosity will finally be satisfied.

The new soul explains to the poets that the mountain of Purgatory is free from all earthly weather and change. The only "alteration" is the divine event of a soul's purification being completed. When a soul's will is finally free from its inclination to sin, the mountain trembles and all the other souls shout "Gloria" to God. The soul reveals that he himself has just completed his 500-year penance, which is why they witnessed the event. Delighted to have his question answered, Dante listens as Virgil asks the soul to reveal his name and story.

The soul reveals his identity as the Roman poet Statius. He explains that he lived during the time of Titus and was famous for his poetry, particularly his epics, the Thebaid and the unfinished Achilleid. He professes profound admiration for Virgil's Aeneid, calling it his mother and nurse in poetry, the source of his inspiration. He concludes by stating he would willingly spend another year in Purgatory just for the chance to have lived when Virgil was alive.

Upon hearing Statius's fervent praise for the Aeneid, Dante cannot suppress a smile, despite Virgil's silent command to stay quiet. Statius notices and asks for an explanation. Caught in a dilemma, Dante is given permission by Virgil to speak. He then reveals to the astonished Statius that his guide is none other than Virgil himself. Overcome with emotion, Statius tries to embrace Virgil's feet, but Virgil stops him, reminding him that they are both incorporeal shades. Statius explains his gesture as proof of the love that made him forget their 'insubstantiality' and treat a shade as a solid object.

## Canto 22

The angel of the fifth terrace erases a 'P' from the narrator's forehead. As they ascend, Virgil asks Statius how he, a man of such wisdom, could have been avaricious. Statius explains he was actually the opposite—prodigal (a spendthrift)—and this sin is purged in the same circle as avarice, a realization he came to by reading a line in Virgil's *Aeneid*. Virgil then asks how Statius became a Christian, as his own poems show no evidence of it. Statius gives Virgil full credit, explaining that he interpreted Virgil's Fourth Eclogue as a prophecy of Christ. He confesses that he was a secret Christian out of fear, and this lukewarmness is why he spent over 400 years on the fourth terrace (for the slothful) before ascending to the fifth.

Statius asks Virgil about the fate of other classical poets. Virgil explains they reside with him in Limbo, along with many other famous Greek and Latin figures, including characters from Statius's own epics. Having reached a new terrace, the three poets continue their journey, with Dante following behind and listening intently to the poetic discourse between Virgil and Statius.

The poets' discussion is interrupted by a strange, inverted tree bearing sweet-smelling fruit. As they approach, a voice from the branches warns them they will be denied the food and then recites examples of temperance: Mary at the wedding at Cana, ancient Roman women, Daniel, the inhabitants of the Golden Age, and John the Baptist in the desert. This serves as the 'whip' for the gluttonous on this terrace.

## Canto 23

While the narrator stares at a strange tree, Virgil urges him onward. They soon encounter the souls of the gluttonous, emaciated figures who are weeping and singing a psalm. The narrator is struck by their skeletal appearance and wonders how the mere scent of fruit and water can cause such suffering. One of the souls then recognizes the narrator and calls out to him in astonishment.

The narrator recognizes the emaciated soul by his voice as his friend, Forese Donati. Grieved by his appearance, the narrator asks what causes such torment. Forese explains that a divine power emanating from the tree and water thins them out. The scent of the fruit and water kindles an insatiable desire, which is a pain that is constantly renewed. However, Forese corrects himself, calling this pain a 'solace,' because the same will that draws them to their punishment is what led Christ joyfully to the cross to redeem humanity.

Dante asks his friend Forese how he ascended to the terrace of the gluttonous so quickly, less than five years after his death, given that he was a late repentant. Forese explains it was due to the ceaseless, devout prayers of his virtuous wife, Nella. He contrasts her piety with the immodesty of other Florentine women, delivering a harsh prophecy that they will soon face divine punishment for their shamelessness.

Dante explains his presence to his friend Forese Donati. He acknowledges their shared sinful past, then explains how Virgil rescued him from that life when the moon was full and led him through Hell. He continues by saying that Virgil's guidance is bringing him up the mountain of Purgatory until he can meet Beatrice, at which point Virgil must leave him. Dante then identifies Virgil by name, and also points out the other soul with them (Statius), explaining he is the one whose recent graduation from Purgatory caused the mountain to tremble.

## Canto 24

While walking, the narrator continues his conversation with Forese Donati. Forese explains that his sister, Piccarda, is already triumphant in Heaven and then, at the narrator's request, points out several other notable souls among the gluttonous. These include the poet Bonagiunta of Lucca, Pope Martin IV (purging his love for eels and wine), Ubaldin da la Pila, Archbishop Bonifazio, and Messer Marchese, all of whom seem content to be named.

The narrator speaks with the soul of Bonagiunta of Lucca. Bonagiunta prophesies that Dante will be made to appreciate Lucca by a woman named Gentucca. He then identifies Dante as the poet who began the 'sweet new style.' Dante defines his poetics as faithfully writing down what Love dictates to him. This explanation allows Bonagiunta to understand the crucial difference between Dante's school of poetry and that of his predecessors, like Guittone d'Arezzo and the Notary.

Forese Donati and the other souls of the gluttonous hurry on their way. Forese briefly stays behind to speak with the narrator, prophesying the violent death of his brother, Corso Donati, who is to blame for Florence's corruption. He then departs, explaining that time is too precious in Purgatory to delay, and the narrator continues with his two great guides, Virgil and Statius.

The poets encounter a second tree on the terrace of the gluttonous. Souls beneath it beg futilely for its fruit. A voice from the branches explains the tree is an offshoot of the one in Eden and warns them away. It then recites examples of punished gluttony (the Centaurs and Gideon's soldiers). As they walk on, an angel, brilliant red and shining, directs them to the next ascent. The angel's wing erases a 'P' from the narrator's forehead, and he hears the Beatitude for those who hunger for righteousness.

## Canto 25

Dante and Virgil ascend to the next terrace. Dante is hesitant to ask his pressing question: how can incorporeal shades suffer from emaciation if they do not need food? Virgil encourages him to speak. After Dante asks, Virgil provides two brief classical analogies (Meleager and a mirror image) but then defers the full, complex explanation to Statius, whom he asks to act as the "healer" of Dante's intellectual "wounds." Statius humbly agrees.

Statius begins a scholastic explanation of human generation. He describes how the "perfect blood" (semen) acts on female matter to form a fetus, first with a vegetative soul (like a plant), then a sensitive soul (like a sea-sponge). He then explains that once the embryo's brain is sufficiently developed, God himself directly breathes a rational soul into it. This higher soul absorbs the lower functions, becoming a single entity that can live, feel, and think. He uses the analogy of sunlight turning grape juice into wine to illustrate this divine process.

Statius completes his explanation of how incorporeal souls can have physical sensations. He describes that upon death, when Lachesis (one of the Fates) cuts the thread of life, the soul's 'formative power' impresses itself on the surrounding air, creating an 'aerial body' or shade. This shade is attached to the soul, like a flame to a fire, and can express emotions and experience sensations like speaking, weeping, and hunger. This, he concludes, is the reason the narrator sees emaciated souls on the terrace of the gluttonous.

The narrator and Virgil arrive at the seventh and final terrace of Purgatory, where the lustful are punished by walking through a wall of fire. The poets proceed on a narrow, flame-free ledge. The souls within the fire sing a hymn, 'Summae Deus clementiae,' and shout out examples of chastity—the Virgin Mary, the goddess Diana, and virtuous spouses—which serve as their 'food' and 'treatment' to heal their final wound of sin before they can enter the Earthly Paradise.

## Canto 26

Walking single file along the edge of the seventh terrace, the narrator's shadow on the flames makes them seem hotter, alerting the souls of the lustful to his living presence. One soul, burning with thirst and fire, asks him to explain how he can cast a shadow. Before the narrator can answer, a second group of souls appears, walking in the opposite direction. The two groups greet each other with a brief, chaste kiss, like ants touching antennae, before continuing their separate penances.

The two groups of lustful souls, after greeting each other, shout out examples of their specific sins: "Sodom and Gomorrah" and the myth of Pasiphaë. They then part ways like migrating cranes. The first group approaches the narrator, who explains he is a living man on a divinely guided journey. He asks them to identify themselves and the other group so he can record their story. The souls are struck dumb with amazement, like a simple mountaineer seeing a city for the first time, before their shock subsides.

The soul speaking identifies himself as the poet Guido Guinizzelli and explains the sins of the two groups on this terrace: his group is punished for heterosexual lust (exemplified by Pasiphaë) and the other for homosexual lust (exemplified by Caesar). Overwhelmed with reverence at meeting his poetic 'father,' the narrator stands speechless for a moment before offering his devoted service.

Guido Guinizzelli responds to the narrator's reverence and, in turn, praises another poet, Arnaut Daniel, as a 'better craftsman.' After criticizing popular literary judgment and requesting a prayer, Guinizzelli vanishes into the flames. The narrator then addresses Arnaut, who replies in his native Provençal, expressing both his sorrow for his past sins and his joy for his coming salvation. He begs the narrator to remember his suffering before he too disappears into the refining fire.

## Canto 27

As the sun sets, the poets are met by the angel of the seventh terrace, who commands them to pass through a wall of fire. The narrator is frozen with terror, imagining being burned alive. Virgil tries to reassure him, but only succeeds in convincing him to enter when he reveals that the fire is the only thing standing between the narrator and Beatrice. At her name, the narrator's resolve returns. Virgil, amused, leads the way into the flames, placing the narrator between himself and Statius for protection.

The narrator passes through the wall of fire, encouraged by Virgil's mention of Beatrice. An angel guides them to a staircase leading to the Earthly Paradise. Night falls, halting their progress according to the law of the mountain. The three poets bed down on the steps, where the narrator, like a goat watched by shepherds (Virgil and Statius), gazes at the unusually bright stars before falling into a prophetic sleep.

At dawn, the narrator has a prophetic dream of a beautiful young woman named Leah. She explains that she represents the active life, gathering flowers to make a garland, while her sister Rachel represents the contemplative life, endlessly gazing at her own reflection. As the pre-dawn light grows stronger, the narrator awakens to find Virgil and Statius already up and ready to continue.

Virgil declares his guidance complete. He tells the narrator he has brought him through Hell's eternal fire and Purgatory's temporal fire, and his own reason can see no further. He proclaims the narrator's will is now free, upright, and whole, and that he should follow his own pleasure as a guide in the Earthly Paradise while awaiting Beatrice. Virgil concludes by crowning and mitering the narrator, making him sovereign over himself.

## Canto 28

The narrator, eager to explore, enters the Earthly Paradise, a vibrant and fragrant divine forest. He walks slowly over the perfumed ground, feeling a sweet, constant breeze. The leaves tremble and bend, while birds sing joyfully in the treetops, their song accompanied by the rustling of the leaves, a sound the narrator compares to the wind in the pine forest of Chiassi. He walks so deep into this ancient wood that he can no longer see where he entered.

The narrator's walk through the Earthly Paradise is halted by a clear river. On the other side, he sees a beautiful woman, Matelda, singing and gathering flowers. He calls out to her, comparing her to Proserpina, and asks her to come closer. She gracefully approaches the bank, allowing him to hear her song. The narrator then laments the small but uncrossable river that separates them, comparing his frustration to Leander's hatred for the Hellespont.

The woman, Matelda, addresses the poets' surprise at her joyous laughter. She explains that Psalm 92 clarifies why this place, the 'nest' of humanity, is joyous. She then offers to answer any of the narrator's questions. The narrator responds that the presence of water and wind in the Earthly Paradise contradicts what he was previously told about Purgatory being free from earthly phenomena.

Matelda explains the nature of the Earthly Paradise to the narrator. She clarifies that the wind is not earthly weather but the result of the heavens' rotation, which spreads generative power across the world. The water comes from a divine fount, splitting into two rivers: Lethe, which erases the memory of sin, and Eunoë, which restores the memory of good deeds. As a final grace, she reveals that this place is the very Golden Age dreamed of by the ancient poets. Hearing this, the narrator sees Virgil and Statius smile, acknowledging the truth in the old myths.

## Canto 29

Matelda concludes her speech by singing a verse from the Psalms. She then walks along the riverbank with the narrator following. The river bends, and shortly after, she tells the narrator to stop and pay attention. A sudden, enduring bright light and a sweet melody fill the forest. The narrator reflects on Eve's disobedience, which deprived humanity of this paradise. The light intensifies into a fire-like glow, and the melody resolves into discernible songs, heralding an approaching procession.

The narrator invokes the Muses to help him describe the divine procession he is about to witness. He sees what at first appear to be seven golden trees, but as he gets closer, he realizes they are seven candelabra. Matelda chides him for focusing only on the lights and not on the people in white who follow. The candelabra leave seven streams of colored light in the air behind them, like banners, which create a rainbow.

The narrator describes the next part of the divine procession. Under the rainbow-like banners of the seven candelabra, twenty-four elders, representing the books of the Old Testament, walk two by two, singing a blessing. They are followed by four living creatures, representing the four Gospels, who are covered in eyes and have six wings each. The narrator directs the reader to Ezekiel for their description, but notes that he follows John's account regarding the number of wings.

The narrator describes the central part of the divine procession: a triumphal chariot pulled by a griffin (symbolizing Christ and the Church). To its right dance three ladies representing the theological virtues, and to its left, four ladies representing the cardinal virtues. They are followed by figures representing the books of the New Testament. The procession halts when the chariot is directly opposite the narrator.

## Canto 30

The divine procession halts, and Beatrice appears in a cloud of flowers, veiled and dressed in the colors of the theological virtues. Overwhelmed, the narrator turns to speak to Virgil, only to find his guide has vanished. The narrator weeps, and Beatrice sternly rebukes him by name, questioning his worthiness to be there. Her harshness, followed by the angels' song of compassion, causes the narrator to break down in tears of shame. Beatrice then explains to the angels how the narrator strayed from the righteous path after her death, and why this arduous journey was the only way to save him, demanding he show full repentance before he can be cleansed.

## Canto 31

Beatrice directly demands a confession from the shame-stricken narrator. Overwhelmed, he can only manage a barely audible "yes" before breaking down in tears. She presses him further, asking what worldly temptations and false promises made him abandon the hope of spiritual progress after her death. Weeping, the narrator confesses that "present things with their false pleasure" led him astray as soon as he could no longer see her.

Beatrice continues her rebuke of the weeping narrator. She states that his confession is necessary for his own sake, not because God doesn't already know his sins. She admonishes him for being led astray by earthly pleasures after her death, when the loss of her, the highest earthly good, should have taught him to seek Heaven. Comparing him to a foolish bird easily trapped, she commands him to lift his head. When he does, he sees Beatrice gazing at the Griffin. Her beauty, even veiled, surpasses her earthly form, and the nettle of repentance stings him so powerfully that he faints from overwhelming shame and remorse.

The narrator regains consciousness to find Matelda pulling him through the river Lethe. After being ritually submerged to drink the water and forget his sins, he is presented to the four cardinal virtues. They explain they will lead him to Beatrice's eyes, but that the three theological virtues will be needed to comprehend the deeper reality within them. They bring him before Beatrice, who stands by the griffin, and urge him to look into her eyes—the 'emeralds' from which Love once launched his assault on the narrator.

The narrator gazes into Beatrice's eyes and witnesses a miracle: the reflection of the Griffin (Christ) alternates between its divine and human natures, while the creature itself remains still. Lost in this vision, the narrator sees the three theological virtues dance forward and sing, begging Beatrice to unveil her smile, her 'second beauty.' The canto concludes with an apostrophe on the impossibility of any poet capturing the splendor of the now-unveiled Beatrice.

## Canto 32

The narrator is so fixated on Beatrice's unveiled face that he is blind to all else until the theological virtues warn him he is staring 'too fixedly.' Temporarily blinded by her radiance, he recovers to see that the entire divine procession has turned and is now marching in the opposite direction. He, Virgil, and Statius follow the chariot, walking to the rhythm of an angelic song. After they have gone a short distance, Beatrice descends from the chariot.

The divine procession reaches the Tree of Knowledge, which is bare. The Griffin (Christ) is praised for not eating from it and then ties the pole of the chariot (the Church) to its trunk, causing the tree to miraculously bloom with reddish-purple flowers. The souls sing an incomprehensible hymn that overwhelms the narrator, who falls asleep. He compares his inability to describe this sleep to an artist's inability to paint such a state, and instead describes being woken by a bright light and a voice.

The narrator awakens from his swoon, comparing his experience to the Transfiguration of Christ. He finds himself being watched over by Matelda. He asks where Beatrice is, and Matelda points her out, sitting alone beneath the newly blooming Tree of Knowledge, guarding the Chariot while the rest of the divine procession ascends to Heaven. The seven virtues form a circle around her. Beatrice then addresses the narrator, telling him his time in the Earthly Paradise will be short before he joins her as a citizen of Heavenly Rome. She commands him to watch what happens next to the Chariot and to write it all down upon his return to the world. The narrator obediently turns his full attention to the Chariot.

Dante witnesses a series of allegorical attacks on the Chariot (the Church). An eagle (the Roman Empire) strikes it; a fox (heresy) invades but is repulsed by Beatrice; the eagle returns to leave its feathers (the Donation of Constantine), prompting a heavenly lament. A dragon (schism) rips out part of the floor. The Chariot then transforms into a seven-headed monster, overgrown with feathers. A whore (the corrupt Papacy) sits atop it, attended by a giant (the French monarchy). When the whore glances at Dante, the giant beats her and drags both her and the monster away into the forest, symbolizing the Avignon Papacy.

## Canto 33

The seven virtues begin singing a sorrowful psalm in response to the allegorical destruction of the Church. Beatrice, deeply moved, responds with a biblical prophecy of her temporary absence and eventual return. She then leads Dante, Matelda, and Statius away, summoning Dante closer to her side. She encourages him to ask the questions he holds, but Dante, overwhelmed by reverence, can only stammer that she already knows his needs.

Beatrice delivers a cryptic prophecy about a future savior, the 'DXV,' who will avenge the Church. She rebukes the narrator for being intellectually hardened by his past sins, explaining that this is why he cannot understand her words. When the narrator claims not to remember ever straying from her, Beatrice points out that his drinking from the river Lethe, which erases the memory of sin, is the very proof of his guilt. She promises to speak more clearly from now on.

At midday, the divine procession halts. The narrator asks Beatrice about the two rivers, Eunoë and Lethe, which spring from a single source. Beatrice explains that his memory is clouded by more intense experiences and instructs Matelda to lead him to the river Eunoë to restore his memory of good deeds. Matelda takes the narrator and Statius to the river. After drinking from it, the narrator feels completely remade, like a new plant. He concludes the canto, and the book of Purgatory, by declaring he is now pure and ready to ascend to the stars.
