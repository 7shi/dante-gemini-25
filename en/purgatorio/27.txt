Just as when the first rays vibrate
there where its maker shed his blood,
with Ibero falling beneath the high Libra,
and the waves in the Ganges scorched by noon,
so stood the sun; hence the day was departing,
when the angel of God appeared to us, joyful.
Outside the flame he stood upon the bank,
and sang ‘Beati mundo corde!’
in a voice much more alive than ours.
Then: “One does not go further, if first it does not bite,
holy souls, the fire: enter into it,
and to the singing on the other side be not deaf,”
he said to us as we drew near him;
for which I became such, when I heard it,
as is he who is put into the grave.
Upon my clasped hands I stretched myself forward,
looking at the fire and imagining intensely
human bodies I had already seen burning.
My good escorts turned toward me;
and Virgil said to me: “My son,
here there can be torment, but not death.
Remember, remember! And if I
over Geryon guided you safely,
what shall I do now, nearer to God?
Believe for certain that if within the belly
of this flame you were to stay a full thousand years,
it could not make you bald of a single hair.
And if you perhaps believe that I deceive you,
go toward it, and get proof for yourself
with your own hands on the hem of your clothes.
Put down now, put down all fear;
turn this way and come: enter securely!”.
And I still firm and against my conscience.
When he saw me stand still firm and hard,
a little troubled he said: “Now see, son:
between Beatrice and you is this wall.”
As at the name of Thisbe, Pyramus opened
his eyes at the point of death, and looked at her,
at the time when the mulberry became vermilion;
so, my hardness made pliant,
I turned to the wise duke, hearing the name
that in my mind always sprouts.
Whereat he shook his head and said: “What!
Do we want to stay on this side?”; then he smiled
as one does at a child who is won by an apple.
Then into the fire he put himself before me,
asking Statius to come behind,
who before had separated us for a long road.
As soon as I was inside, into boiling glass
I would have thrown myself to cool down,
so immeasurable was the fire there.
My sweet father, to comfort me,
kept speaking only of Beatrice,
saying: “I seem to see her eyes already.”
A voice that was singing guided us
from the other side; and we, attentive only to it,
came out to where the ascent began.
‘Come, you blessed of my Father’,
sounded from within a light that was there,
such that it overcame me and I could not look at it.
“The sun is departing,” it added, “and evening comes;
do not stop, but hasten your steps,
while the west does not yet blacken.”
The path ascended straight through the rock
in such a direction that I blocked the rays
of the already low sun before me.
And we had made trial of only a few steps,
when we felt the sun set behind us, I and my sages,
by the shadow that vanished.
And before the horizon in all its immense parts
had become of a single appearance,
and night had assumed all its domains,
each of us made a bed of a step;
for the nature of the mountain took from us
the power to climb further, and the desire.
As the goats, having been swift and bold
on the peaks before they are fed,
now stand quiet, chewing their cud in the shade, while the sun burns hot,
watched by the shepherd, who on his staff
has leaned and serves them as their guard of rest;
and as the herdsman who lodges outdoors,
spends the night alongside his quiet flock,
watching so that a wild beast does not scatter it;
such were all three of us then,
I like a goat, and they like shepherds,
enclosed on this side and that by the high rock-face.
Little of the outside could appear there;
but, through that little, I saw the stars
brighter and larger than their usual.
Thus ruminating and thus gazing at them,
sleep took me; the sleep that often,
before the event happens, knows the news.
At the hour, I believe, when from the east
first Venus beamed upon the mountain,
who seems always to burn with the fire of love,
young and beautiful in a dream it seemed to me
I saw a lady going through a meadow,
gathering flowers; and singing she was saying:
"Let whoever asks my name know
that I am Leah, and I go moving around
my beautiful hands to make myself a garland.
To please myself at the mirror, here I adorn myself;
but my sister Rachel never moves away
from her mirror, and sits all day.
She is eager to see her beautiful eyes
as I am to adorn myself with my hands;
her, seeing, and me, doing, satisfies."
And now because of the pre-dawn splendors,
which to pilgrims arise all the more welcome
as, returning, they lodge less far away,
the shadows were fleeing on all sides,
and my sleep with them; so I rose up,
seeing the great masters already risen.
“That sweet apple which on so many branches
the care of mortals goes in search of,
today will set your hungers at peace.”
Virgil toward me these such
words used; and never were there gifts
that were of a pleasure equal to these.
Such will upon will came to me
to be up above, that at every step then
I felt my feathers for flight grow.
When the whole stairway beneath us
was run and we were on the highest step,
Virgil fixed his eyes upon me,
and said: “The temporal fire and the eternal
you have seen, son; and you have come to a place
where I by myself discern no further.
I have brought you here with intellect and with art;
your own pleasure now take as your guide;
you are out of the steep ways, out of the narrow.
See the sun that shines on your brow;
see the little grasses, the flowers and the small trees
that here the earth by itself alone produces.
While the happy, beautiful eyes come
that, weeping, made me come to you,
you can sit and you can go among them.
Await my word no longer, nor my sign;
free, upright and whole is your will,
and it would be a fault not to act on its judgment:
for which I, over you, crown and miter you.”
