Remember, reader, if ever in the Alps
fog has caught you, through which you could see
no differently than moles through their skin,
how, when the humid and dense vapors
begin to thin, the sphere
of the sun weakly enters through them;
and your imagination will be quick
to grasp how I saw again
the sun at first, which was already setting.
Thus, matching mine with the faithful steps
of my master, I came out of that cloud
to the rays already dead on the low shores.
O imagination that steals us
sometimes so from the outside, that one does not notice
though a thousand trumpets sound around,
who moves you, if sense offers you nothing?
A light moves you which takes form in heaven,
by itself or by a will that guides it down.
Of the impiety of her who changed her form
into the bird that most delights in singing,
the trace appeared in my imagination;
and here my mind was so withdrawn
into itself, that from without came
nothing that was then received by it.
Then rained down into my high fantasy
one crucified, disdainful and fierce
in his aspect, and so was he dying;
around him were the great Ahasuerus,
Esther his wife and the just Mordecai,
who was in word and deed so upright.
And as this image broke
of itself, in the manner of a bubble
for which fails the water beneath which it was made,
there arose in my vision a young girl
crying loudly, and she said: “O queen,
why through wrath have you willed to be nothing?
You have killed yourself not to lose Lavinia;
now you have lost me! It is I who mourn,
mother, your ruin before that of another.”
As sleep is shattered when suddenly
a new light strikes the closed face,
which, shattered, flickers before it all dies;
so my imagining fell away
as soon as a light struck my face,
far greater than that which is in our use.
I was turning to see where I was,
when a voice said, “Here one ascends,”
which removed me from every other intent;
and it made my will so ready
to behold who it was that spoke,
that it never rests, unless it is confronted.
But like the sun that overwhelms our sight
and by excess veils its own form,
so my power of sight failed there.
“This is a divine spirit, who on the
way to go up directs us without being asked,
and with his own light conceals himself.
He acts with us, as a man acts with himself;
for he who waits for a request, though seeing the need,
already sets himself maliciously to refuse.
Now let us match our feet to such an invitation;
let us strive to climb before it grows dark,
for then one could not, until the day returns.”
Thus said my duke, and I with him
turned our steps toward a stairway;
and as soon as I was on the first step,
I felt near me something like the beating of a wing
and a wind fan my face and say: ‘Blessed are
the peacemakers, who are without evil wrath!’.
Already so high above us were
the last rays that the night follows,
that the stars were appearing on many sides.
‘O my strength, why do you so dissolve?’,
I said within myself, for I felt
the power of my legs placed in truce.
We were where no longer ascended
the stair above, and we were halted,
just like a ship that to the shore arrives.
And I waited a little, to see if I might hear
anything in the new circle;
then I turned to my master, and said:
«My sweet father, tell me, what offense
is purged here in the circle where we are?
If our feet must stand, let not your sermon stand».
And he to me: «The love of good, deficient
in its duty, is restored right here;
here the ill-delayed oar is re-beaten.
But so that you may understand more clearly still,
turn your mind to me, and you will take
some good fruit from our delay».
«Neither creator nor creature ever»,
he began, «son, was without love,
either natural or of the mind; and you know it.
The natural is always without error,
but the other can err through an evil object
or through too much or too little vigor.
While it is directed to the first good,
and in the secondary ones measures itself,
it cannot be the cause of evil delight;
but when it twists toward evil, or with more care
or with less than it ought runs to the good,
against its maker the creature works.
From this you can understand that love must be
the seed in you of every virtue
and of every action that deserves punishment.
Now, why love can never from the well-being
of its own subject turn its face,
from self-hate all things are safe;
and because no being can be conceived as divided,
and standing by itself, from the First,
from hating that one every effect is cut off.
It remains, if I reckon my division well,
that the evil that is loved is of one's neighbor; and this
love is born in three ways in your clay.
There is he who, by his neighbor's being suppressed,
hopes for excellence, and only for this desires
that he be put down from his greatness;
there is he who power, grace, honor, and fame
fears to lose because another rises above,
whence he grows so sad that he loves the contrary;
and there is he who seems so shamed by injury,
that he becomes greedy for vengeance,
and such a one must contrive another's harm.
This threefold love is wept for down below:
now I want you to understand the other,
which runs to the good with a corrupt order.
Each one confusedly apprehends a good
in which the soul may find its rest, and desires it;
for which reason each one strives to attain it.
If slow love draws you to see it
or to acquire it, this terrace,
after just repentance, torments you for it.
There is another good that does not make man happy;
it is not happiness, it is not the good
essence, of every good the fruit and root.
The love that too much abandons itself to it,
is wept for in three circles above us;
but how it is reasoned to be tripartite,
I am silent, so that you may seek it for yourself.”
