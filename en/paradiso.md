## Canto 1

The poet begins his final canticle, *Paradiso*, stating he has been to the highest heaven and seen things beyond human memory and expression. He invokes Apollo, asking for the highest poetic power to describe what he can remember of the "blessed kingdom." He alludes to the myth of Apollo and Marsyas to convey the intensity of the divine inspiration he seeks. He laments how rarely humans seek true glory (the laurel wreath) and hopes his work will inspire future poets to seek it.

Dante describes the sun rising at the vernal equinox. Beatrice gazes directly at it, and Dante, by imitating her, is able to do the same beyond normal human capacity. He then turns his gaze upon her and feels himself undergoing a 'transhumanization,' a transformation beyond words, which he compares to the myth of Glaucus. As he begins to ascend, he asks God, who lifted him, whether he ascended in body or only in soul.

As Dante ascends, he is overwhelmed by the music of the spheres and a vast light, which awakens in him an intense desire to understand their cause. Beatrice, reading his mind, explains that he is not on earth but is returning to his proper home in Heaven faster than lightning falls. This explanation solves one doubt but creates another for Dante: he now wonders how his heavy, physical body can pass through the 'light bodies' of the celestial spheres.

Beatrice explains the universal divine order to the narrator. She states that all created things have a natural inclination, an instinct, to move toward God, their source. This instinct acts like a bow shooting every creature toward its proper destination. The narrator's ascent, therefore, is not a miracle but a natural consequence of this order, like fire rising or a river flowing downhill. It would only be a miracle if he, unimpeded by sin, had remained on Earth. Beatrice explains that deviation from this natural course is possible through free will, when a creature is twisted away from its true goal by 'false pleasure,' just as an artist's material can sometimes resist his intended form.

## Canto 2

The poet addresses his readers, warning those in 'little boats' (with little knowledge) to turn back, lest they get lost following his complex journey. He invites the few who have long studied theology (the 'bread of angels') to follow his divinely-guided ship, promising them a sight more wondrous than the Argonauts seeing Jason become a plowman.

The narrator and Beatrice ascend at incredible speed and arrive at the first heaven, the Moon. The Moon appears as a solid, luminous pearl that absorbs the narrator's physical body without being broken. This miracle of a body entering another body prompts the narrator to reflect on the greater mystery of the Incarnation. He then asks Beatrice to explain the cause of the dark spots on the Moon, and before she answers, he offers his own (incorrect) scientific explanation based on rarity and density.

Beatrice refutes the narrator's theory that the Moon's dark spots are caused by varying density. She first argues logically, using the analogy of the fixed stars, that different appearances imply different formal principles, not just variations of a single substance. She then systematically disproves the two possible ways rarity could cause the spots, proposing a scientific experiment with three mirrors to demonstrate that a reflection from a deeper surface is not necessarily dimmer, just smaller. Having cleared the narrator's mind of this false idea, she prepares to give him the true explanation.

Beatrice delivers a complex metaphysical explanation for the spots on the Moon. She describes a celestial hierarchy where divine virtue descends from the highest heaven (the Empyrean), through the Primum Mobile, and is then differentiated and distributed by the angelic intelligences that move each subsequent sphere. This differentiated virtue combines with celestial matter, much like a soul animates a body with various powers in its different limbs. Therefore, the differences in brightness on the Moon are not caused by physical properties like density, but by the varying quality and intensity of the divine 'formal principle' imprinted on different parts of the lunar body.

## Canto 3

Having just been enlightened by Beatrice's explanation of the moon spots, the narrator is about to speak when he sees faint faces, like reflections in clear water. He makes the opposite mistake of Narcissus, thinking these real beings are mere reflections and turning around to find their source. Seeing nothing, he looks back at a smiling Beatrice, who explains his childish error. She reveals that these are 'true substances'—the souls of those who failed to keep their vows, relegated to this lowest sphere—and urges the narrator to speak with them.

Dante speaks with the soul of Piccarda Donati in the Heaven of the Moon. She explains that she and the other souls here are those who were inconstant in their vows. When Dante asks if they desire a higher place, Piccarda explains that the essence of heavenly joy is the perfect alignment of their will with God's. They desire only what they are given, famously stating, "In His will is our peace." This teaches Dante that every part of Heaven is Paradise, though divine grace is bestowed in varying degrees.

Piccarda Donati, after explaining the nature of heavenly contentment, tells her own story. She was a nun forcibly removed from her convent. She then identifies her companion, Empress Constance, who also had her religious vows broken against her will. After speaking, Piccarda sings "Ave, Maria" and vanishes. Dante turns to Beatrice, whose divine radiance is now so bright it overwhelms his sight, causing him to hesitate in asking his next question.

## Canto 4

Dante finds himself paralyzed between two equally urgent doubts, comparing his state to a person starving between two identical foods or a lamb between two identical wolves. Beatrice, seeing his unasked questions on his face, articulates them for him: why violence can reduce the merit of a soul with good will, and whether souls truly return to the stars as Plato taught. She announces she will first address the latter, more 'venomous' question.

Beatrice refutes the Platonic idea that souls return to their originating stars after death. She explains that all blessed souls reside together in the Empyrean (the highest heaven), but they appear to Dante in the lower spheres as a symbolic condescension to his human intellect, which learns through the senses. She contrasts this with Plato's doctrine in the Timaeus, which seems to be meant literally. However, she offers a charitable interpretation: perhaps Plato was speaking allegorically of astrological influence, a principle whose literal misunderstanding led the ancient world into pagan idolatry.

Beatrice addresses Dante's second doubt: how it can be just that souls who were victims of violence (like Piccarda and Constance, who were forced from their convents) have their merit diminished. She explains the difference between an 'absolute will,' which never yields to evil, and a 'relative will,' which can bend under force out of fear of greater harm. The souls' wills were not perfectly steadfast, as shown by their failure to return to the cloister once free. Beatrice then resolves an apparent contradiction: Piccarda spoke of Constance's unwavering inner 'absolute will,' while Beatrice's own explanation refers to the weaker 'relative will' that acted, meaning both statements are true.

Having had his two main doubts resolved by Beatrice, Dante reflects on how the human mind is never satisfied until it reaches the ultimate Truth. He explains that this innate desire for truth naturally gives rise to new questions, which in turn drive the soul's ascent. This emboldens him to pose a new question: can a person compensate for broken vows with other good deeds? Beatrice's loving, divine gaze is so powerful that it overwhelms him, and he nearly faints.

## Canto 5

Beatrice addresses Dante's unspoken question about whether a broken vow can be compensated for. She explains that a vow is the highest form of sacrifice because it involves offering up one's free will, God's greatest gift to intelligent creatures. This makes the pact with God absolute. While the Church can, with its authority (the keys), commute the *matter* of the vow, the new offering must be of even greater value. Beatrice warns mortals against making rash vows, citing the tragic examples of Jephthah and Agamemnon, and exhorts Christians to be steadfast, relying on Scripture and the Church for guidance rather than their own foolish impulses.

Beatrice concludes her explanation, and she and the narrator ascend with arrow-like speed to the second heaven, Mercury. Beatrice's joy makes the planet shine more brightly, and the narrator feels himself transformed. More than a thousand radiant souls approach them like fish drawn to bait, eager to welcome the narrator and increase their love. One soul invites the narrator to ask whatever he desires, and Beatrice encourages him to speak freely and trust them completely.

Dante addresses one of the shining souls in the Heaven of Mercury. He observes that the soul's brilliance comes from its own joy, but asks the soul to reveal its identity and explain its place in this specific heaven. The soul, in response, grows even more radiant with joy, hiding itself completely within its own light before beginning to speak, with its reply reserved for the next canto.

## Canto 6

The soul identifies himself as the Roman Emperor Justinian. He recounts the history of the Roman eagle (the Empire), from Constantine moving its seat east to Constantinople, to its eventual arrival in his own hands. He explains that before his great work of codifying Roman law, he was a heretic, but was converted to the true faith by Pope Agapetus. After his conversion, God inspired him to undertake the legal codification, and he entrusted military matters to his great general, Belisarius.

The soul of Emperor Justinian continues his speech, tracing the glorious history of the Roman Eagle (the Empire) from its mythical origins in Troy through the Roman Republic and the age of Caesar and Augustus. He then explains the divine role of the Empire in God's plan, arguing that the Crucifixion under Tiberius was God's just vengeance on sinful humanity, and that the subsequent destruction of Jerusalem under Titus was vengeance for that act. The history concludes with Charlemagne, as the heir to the Eagle's legacy, defending the Church.

Justinian concludes his speech by condemning the Guelphs and Ghibellines for misusing the imperial symbol. He explains that the souls in Mercury are those who sought earthly honor, and their lesser glory is part of the perfect justice of Heaven. He then points out the soul of Romeo di Villanova, a virtuous advisor who was unjustly exiled, and praises his humble dignity in poverty.

## Canto 7

The soul of Justinian sings a hymn in a mix of Hebrew and Latin before departing with the other souls in a swift dance. Dante hesitates to ask Beatrice a new question, overcome with reverence for her, but she, reading his mind, begins to answer with a radiant smile.

Beatrice explains to the narrator the complex theology behind the Crucifixion. She clarifies how the act could be both a 'just vengeance' for the sin of Adam (punishing fallen human nature) and simultaneously the greatest injustice ever committed (against the divine person of Christ). This duality explains why the Crucifixion, an act that pleased God, could itself be justly avenged by the destruction of Jerusalem.

Beatrice perceives and answers the narrator's next unspoken question: why God chose the Incarnation as the specific means for human redemption. She explains that humanity, created directly by God, fell from grace through sin and could not make satisfaction on its own, as the finite act of humility could never equal the infinite offense of pride. Therefore, God, in his infinite goodness, chose to employ both mercy and justice through the Incarnation of His Son. This method was the most magnificent and generous, as it satisfied divine justice while allowing humanity to participate in its own redemption.

Beatrice explains to the narrator why the four elements are corruptible even though God created them. She distinguishes between things created directly by God (angels, heavens, the human soul), which are incorruptible, and things created indirectly through the influence of the stars (elements, plants, animals), which are corruptible. She concludes by using this logic to argue for the eventual resurrection of the human body.

## Canto 8

This segment describes the narrator's ascent to the third heaven, Venus, the sphere of the lovers. He is greeted by the soul of Charles Martel, who explains his brief life and the unfulfilled potential of his rule. In response to the narrator's question about how good lineage can produce bad offspring, Charles delivers a long discourse on divine providence, celestial influence, and the importance of allowing individual natures to fulfill their God-given roles in society, criticizing how humans force people into unsuitable vocations.

## Canto 9

A new soul in the Heaven of Venus, Cunizza da Romano, identifies herself to Dante. After explaining that she joyfully accepts the amorous nature that placed her in this sphere, she delivers a series of dark prophecies concerning the political corruption and violence in her native region of northeastern Italy. She concludes by explaining that the souls' prophetic knowledge comes from the angelic order of the Thrones, who reflect God's judgment.

Another soul in the Heaven of Venus, Folco of Marseilles, addresses the narrator. He identifies his earthly home, the region of Genoa, and explains his presence in this sphere. He confesses that his earthly love burned as fiercely as that of famous mythological lovers like Dido, but in Heaven, this fault is no longer a cause for repentance but for joy—not in the sin itself, which is forgotten, but in God's power, which ordained all things and turned this earthly passion toward a heavenly end. The souls here admire the divine art that channeled their powerful affections for good.

The soul of Folco of Marseilles identifies another brilliant soul in the Heaven of Venus as Rahab, the prostitute from Jericho who aided Joshua. Folco explains she was the first soul from Christ's triumph assumed into this sphere. He then launches into a harsh critique of Dante's Florence, a city planted by Satan, which produces the 'accursed flower' (the florin) that has corrupted the Church, making popes and cardinals focus on canon law and wealth instead of the Gospel. He concludes with a prophecy that Rome and the Vatican will soon be freed from this 'adultery.'

## Canto 10

The poet calls the reader to contemplate the divine order of the cosmos, created by the Trinity. He directs the reader's gaze to the intersection of the celestial equator and the ecliptic, praising the divine artistry that designed the heavens. He explains the vital importance of the ecliptic's tilt for life on Earth. Finally, he tells the reader to reflect on this prelude while he, the poet, turns his full attention to the main subject of his writing.

The narrator enters the fourth heaven, the Sun, the realm of the wise. The speed of his ascent with Beatrice is instantaneous. He is overwhelmed by the light within the Sun, a brilliance beyond human description. He sees the "fourth family" of Heaven (the theologians and philosophers) and, at Beatrice's urging, gives thanks to God, the "Sun of the angels." His devotion is so total that he momentarily forgets Beatrice, who smiles at this, her radiance then re-dividing his focused mind.

The narrator sees a circle of twelve brilliant souls, the 'burning suns,' form a crown around him and Beatrice. Their singing is even more beautiful than their luminous appearance. The narrator compares this crown of lights to a lunar halo. He reflects that the joys of Heaven, like this song, are impossible to describe on Earth. The souls circle the poets three times, like stars around the celestial poles, then stop, resembling dancers waiting for the next musical cue.

One of the twelve souls, identifying himself as Thomas Aquinas, speaks to the narrator. He confirms the narrator's divine mission and then proceeds to identify each of the other eleven brilliant souls in the circle. He names Albertus Magnus, Gratian, Peter Lombard, King Solomon, Dionysius the Areopagite, Orosius, Boethius, Isidore of Seville, Bede the Venerable, Richard of St. Victor, and, finally, the controversial philosopher Siger of Brabant.

The segment uses a simile comparing the movement and song of the circle of wise souls to a monastery clock calling the faithful to morning prayer. The souls' harmonious voices and motion are described as a perfect, sweet experience that can only be fully known in Heaven, where joy is eternal.

## Canto 11

Dante reflects on the foolishness of worldly pursuits compared to his celestial welcome. Thomas Aquinas, seeing Dante's unspoken doubts about his previous statements, begins a long discourse. He explains that Providence sent two champions, St. Francis and St. Dominic, to guide the Church. Aquinas, a Dominican, announces he will tell the story of St. Francis, as praising one is to praise both.

Thomas Aquinas recounts the life of St. Francis of Assisi. He describes Francis's birthplace, likening Francis himself to a sun rising in the East. He then tells the story of Francis's mystical marriage to Lady Poverty, who had been spurned since the time of Christ. This union inspired his first followers, Bernard, Egidius, and Sylvester. Aquinas outlines the key moments of Francis's mission: the initial approval of his order by Pope Innocent III, the formal confirmation by Pope Honorius III, his journey to preach to the Sultan in Egypt, and finally, his receiving of the stigmata from Christ on Mount La Verna. The account concludes with Francis's death, where he commends Lady Poverty to his friars and desires no elaborate funeral.

Thomas Aquinas concludes his praise of St. Francis by calling St. Dominic his worthy colleague in steering the Church. He then laments the corruption of his own Dominican order, comparing the friars to a greedy flock that has strayed from the shepherd's path. He says only a few remain faithful. Finally, he tells Dante that if he has paid attention, he will now understand Aquinas's earlier cryptic remark about "the plant from which one splinters" and the meaning of the phrase "where one fattens well, if one does not stray."

## Canto 12

A second circle of twelve wise souls appears, encircling the first one. The two concentric circles rotate and sing in perfect harmony, which the narrator compares to a double rainbow. When they stop, a voice from the new circle begins to speak, drawing the narrator's attention like a compass needle to the pole star.

The soul of St. Bonaventure begins to speak, explaining that love compels him to praise the other great champion of the Church, St. Dominic, just as his own leader, St. Francis, was praised. He recounts the life and mission of St. Dominic, from his birth in Caleruega, Spain, and the prophecies surrounding it, to his rejection of worldly ecclesiastical wealth in favor of fighting heresy. He describes Dominic as a torrent of faith and doctrine who revitalized the 'garden' of the Church, from whom the Dominican order flowed like streams.

St. Bonaventure, after praising St. Dominic, laments the corruption of his own Franciscan order. He states that the path laid by St. Francis has been abandoned and the order has become reversed. He prophesies a coming judgment on the corrupt friars (the 'tares') but notes that a few faithful still remain. He condemns the leaders of both the overly lax and the overly strict factions within the order, naming them by their hometowns (Casale and Acquasparta).

St. Bonaventure introduces himself and the other eleven souls in the second ring of wise spirits. He identifies prominent theologians and churchmen, including early Franciscans, Hugh of Saint Victor, Peter Comestor, Peter of Spain, Nathan, Chrysostom, Anselm, Donatus, Rabanus, and Joachim of Fiore. He concludes by explaining that he and his companions were moved to praise St. Dominic by the courteous and eloquent speech with which Thomas Aquinas had praised St. Francis.

## Canto 13

The narrator struggles to describe a magnificent celestial vision. He asks the reader to imagine a complex constellation formed by the twenty-four souls of the wise, arranged in two concentric, counter-rotating circles. Their song is not a pagan hymn but a praise of the Trinity and the Incarnation. After their dance and song conclude, they turn their attention to the narrator.

Thomas Aquinas addresses Dante's unspoken doubt regarding his earlier statement that King Solomon was unequaled in wisdom. Aquinas explains the process of creation: the divine idea descends through the heavens and is imperfectly imprinted on mortal matter by Nature, like an artist with a trembling hand. However, when God acts directly—as He did in the creation of Adam and the Incarnation of Christ—the result is perfect. Therefore, Aquinas affirms Dante's belief that human nature was never more perfect than in Adam and Christ.

Aquinas continues his explanation to Dante. He clarifies that Solomon's unequaled wisdom was not absolute intellectual knowledge (like metaphysics, logic, or geometry) but a specific *kingly prudence*—the practical wisdom needed to be a good and sufficient ruler. Solomon asked for this specific type of wisdom when God offered him a choice. Therefore, when Aquinas said "none has arisen" (surse) to equal him, he was referring specifically to the category of kings, among whom the good are rare. With this distinction, the statement about Solomon's unique wisdom can coexist with the belief in the perfect human nature of Adam and Christ.

Thomas Aquinas concludes his discourse with a stern warning to the narrator against making hasty intellectual and moral judgments. He advises slow, deliberate thought, illustrating the dangers of intellectual arrogance with examples of philosophers (Parmenides, Melissus, Bryson) and heretics (Sabellius, Arius) who erred. He then cautions against judging others' salvation, using parables of a thorn bush that unexpectedly blooms and a swift ship that sinks at the harbor's entrance to show that final outcomes are known only to God and can defy appearances.

## Canto 14

Beatrice voices Dante's unasked question to the circle of wise souls: will their radiance remain with them eternally after the Resurrection, and if so, how will their physical eyes withstand it? In response, the two circles of souls express greater joy in their dance and song, singing a hymn to the Trinity.

King Solomon, from the inner circle of the wise, answers Beatrice's question about the Resurrection. He explains that their radiance will last as long as their heavenly joy. When reunited with their glorified bodies, their complete being will be more pleasing, and this wholeness will increase the light of grace they receive, which in turn increases their vision of God, their love (ardor), and their radiance. He explains that the light of the resurrected body will outshine their current spiritual light, and their new physical senses will be strong enough to endure this delight. Both circles of souls shout "Amen!" showing their yearning for their physical bodies, not just for themselves but for their loved ones.

A third circle of bright souls appears around the previous two, a sight so brilliant Dante's eyes fail. Beatrice's smile restores him, and they are instantly transported to the fifth heaven, the sphere of Mars, which is noticeably redder. Dante offers a silent prayer of thanks, which he knows is accepted when a great cross of light, formed by two rays of glorious souls, appears. He exclaims in wonder to God, whom he calls "Helios."

The narrator describes the magnificent cross of light formed by the souls of the warrior-saints in the Heaven of Mars. This cross flashes with the image of Christ, and the souls move within it like motes in a sunbeam, creating a melody of praise. The narrator can only make out the words "Rise again" and "Conquer." He is so captivated by this vision that he momentarily forgets even Beatrice's beauty, and explains that this is because divine beauty becomes more potent as one ascends, and he had not yet turned to see her even more powerful, higher-level gaze.

## Canto 15

The heavenly song of the warrior-saints falls silent to encourage the narrator to speak. A soul, like a shooting star, detaches from an arm of the great cross and glides to its base. This soul, the narrator's ancestor Cacciaguida, greets him in Latin, recalling Anchises greeting Aeneas. The narrator is stunned by both the soul and Beatrice's radiant smile. Cacciaguida then speaks, but his words are too profound for the narrator to understand.

Cacciaguida, now speaking in terms the narrator can understand, praises the Trinity and explains that he knows the narrator's unspoken questions because he sees them in God's mind. He urges the narrator to speak anyway, to better fulfill his loving desire to answer. After receiving an encouraging smile from Beatrice, the narrator explains that his mortal intellect is unequal to his affection, and thus he can only thank his ancestor with his heart before asking him to reveal his name.

Dante's ancestor, Cacciaguida, identifies himself and then extols the virtues of 12th-century Florence. He contrasts the city's past sobriety, modesty, and simple domestic life with the luxury, corruption, and political strife of Dante's time. He uses specific examples of virtuous citizens and customs, such as Bellincion Berti and the domesticity of Florentine women, to illustrate this idealized past, prophesying that Florence's current glory will lead to its downfall.

Cacciaguida continues his life story. He describes his birth and baptism in old Florence, naming his brothers and explaining the origin of Dante's family name from his wife's lineage. He then recounts how he was knighted by Emperor Conrad III and followed him on the Second Crusade, where he was killed by Muslims. He considers his death a martyrdom that brought him to the peace of Heaven.

## Canto 16

Dante reflects on the fleeting nature of nobility, admitting he felt pride in his ancestor even in Heaven. He addresses Cacciaguida with formal respect, prompted by a subtle smile from Beatrice. Filled with joy, Dante asks his ancestor about his own lineage, the years of his youth, and the size and leading families of 12th-century Florence.

Cacciaguida describes 12th-century Florence, contrasting its past purity and order with the present-day city's corruption, which he blames on immigration from the countryside and political strife caused by the Church. He gives his birthdate through a complex astrological calculation and identifies his home's location. He reflects on the inevitable rise and fall of families and cities, comparing Florence's shifting state to the tides, before preparing to list the great old Florentine families whose fame has since faded.

Cacciaguida continues his nostalgic list of the great families of 12th-century Florence, many of whom were already in decline or have since fallen. He contrasts their old virtue with the corruption of the present, blaming newcomers and arrogant families like the Adimari for Florence's strife. He mentions families by name, referencing their coats of arms and specific historical deeds or scandals. He concludes by alluding to the Buondelmonti family, whose arrival in a particular neighborhood is cited as the spark for the city's ruinous factionalism.

Cacciaguida identifies the Buondelmonti affair—where Buondelmonte jilted his fiancée from the Amidei family—as the source of the factional strife that destroyed Florence's happiness. He laments that Buondelmonte had not drowned before reaching the city, thus sparing it from conflict. He concludes his portrait of 12th-century Florence by recalling its former peace, justice, and unity, a time before its flag, the lily, was ever reversed in defeat or changed color due to internal division.

## Canto 17

Dante, needing to understand the dark prophecies about his future, compares himself to Phaethon seeking clarification. Encouraged by Beatrice, he addresses his ancestor Cacciaguida, praising his divine foresight and asking him to reveal the fortune that awaits, arguing that a foreseen blow is easier to bear.

Cacciaguida prophesies Dante's exile from Florence. He explains that divine foreknowledge doesn't negate free will, then details the pain of exile: losing one's home, depending on others' charity, and being surrounded by foolish companions, whom Dante will honorably separate himself from before their downfall.

Cacciaguida continues his prophecy, telling Dante that his first refuge will be with the "great Lombard" (Bartolomeo della Scala) in Verona. He also prophesies the future greatness of Bartolomeo's younger brother, Cangrande della Scala, whose deeds will be notable. Cacciaguida shares incredible details about Cangrande's future that Dante is forbidden to repeat. He concludes by telling Dante not to envy his persecutors, as Dante's fame will long outlive their punishment.

After hearing the prophecy of his exile, Dante expresses a new fear to his ancestor, Cacciaguida: if he tells the full, harsh truth of what he's seen in the afterlife, he may lose all hope of finding refuge. Cacciaguida responds by commanding him to tell the whole story without falsehood. He explains that while the truth will be painful for the guilty, it will ultimately provide vital nourishment for its readers. He adds that Dante's words, like the wind, will strike the highest peaks (the most powerful people) and that this is precisely why he has only been shown famous souls throughout his journey—because the human mind only accepts lessons proven by well-known examples.

## Canto 18

After hearing the prophecy of his exile, Dante turns to Beatrice for comfort. She tells him to look away from her and back at the cross of Mars, as paradise is not only in her eyes. Cacciaguida, now ready to speak again, points out other great warrior-saints on the cross, naming Joshua, Judas Maccabeus, Charlemagne, Roland, and others. As each is named, their soul flashes like lightning along the cross. Cacciaguida then rejoins the other souls, showing his own skill as one of heaven's singers.

Dante and Beatrice ascend to the sixth heaven, Jupiter, the sphere of the just rulers. Dante realizes their transition by the increased radiance of Beatrice's smile. Here, the souls of the just fly like birds and use their light to spell out the first verse of the Book of Wisdom in Latin: 'DILIGITE IUSTITIAM, QUI IUDICATIS TERRAM' ('Love justice, you who judge the earth'). After spelling the phrase, the souls pause, arranged in the final letter 'M,' and are joined by other singing spirits.

The souls in Jupiter rearrange themselves from the letter 'M' into the shape of a magnificent eagle, a symbol of divine justice. The narrator reflects on God as the divine artist who orchestrates this celestial formation.

The narrator addresses the celestial eagle, praying that God will punish the corruption of the Church, particularly Pope John XXII, who wages war not with swords but with interdicts and excommunications for financial gain. He imagines the Pope declaring his devotion is to the image on the florin (John the Baptist), not to the Church's founders, Peter and Paul.

## Canto 19

The celestial Eagle, formed by the souls of just rulers in Jupiter, speaks to the narrator with a single voice. It declares it is exalted for its justice and piety, lamenting that while the wicked on Earth praise this memory, they do not follow its example. The narrator, addressing the unified souls, begs them to solve a profound and long-held doubt he has concerning divine justice, a question for which he could find no answer on Earth.

The celestial Eagle, formed by just rulers, compares itself to a falcon before addressing the narrator's doubt about divine justice. It explains that human reason is finite and cannot comprehend God's infinite will, which is the ultimate standard of justice. The Eagle articulates the narrator's specific question—why a virtuous man born outside Christendom is damned—and rebukes him for daring to judge God's plan. It concludes that God's will is inherently good and just, and it is the source of all created good, not subject to it.

The celestial Eagle, using the simile of a stork feeding its young, explains that God's judgment is as incomprehensible to mortals as the Eagle's song is to the narrator. It then states that no one enters Heaven without faith in Christ, either before or after the Crucifixion. However, it immediately presents a paradox: many who cry "Christ, Christ!" will be further from God at the Last Judgment than righteous non-Christians (like "the Ethiopian" or "the Persians"), who will condemn the wicked Christian kings when the book of judgment is opened.

The celestial Eagle lists numerous corrupt Christian kings of Dante's era, detailing their specific sins—such as devastation, currency debasement, pride, lust, avarice, and cowardice—and prophesying how their shame will be recorded at the Last Judgment. The Eagle concludes with a lament for nations suffering under such rule.

## Canto 20

The Eagle of Justice identifies the six souls of just rulers who form its eye. They are King David (the pupil), the Roman Emperor Trajan, King Hezekiah, Emperor Constantine, William II of Sicily, and the Trojan pagan Ripheus. The Eagle explains the specific reason for each soul's salvation, highlighting the mysterious workings of divine grace.

The Eagle of Justice, after pausing its song, explains to the still-confused narrator how virtuous pagans like Trajan and Ripheus could be saved. It acknowledges that the narrator believes this truth on faith but cannot understand the mechanism. The Eagle then explains that the kingdom of heaven can be "conquered" by fervent love and hope, a "violence" that God willingly submits to, conquering in turn with His goodness. It confirms the narrator's astonishment is focused on these two pagan souls, the "first" and "fifth" lights in the Eagle's brow, who now adorn the kingdom of the angels.

The celestial Eagle explains to Dante how the pagan Emperor Trajan and the Trojan hero Ripheus were saved. Trajan was miraculously resurrected after the prayers of Pope Gregory the Great, at which point he converted to Christianity. Ripheus, for his innate love of justice, was granted a special grace: a prophetic vision of Christ's redemption, which he believed, and the three theological virtues served as his baptism. The Eagle concludes by warning mortals against judging God's mysterious predestination and describes how the two saved souls flashed their lights in perfect harmony with its speech.

## Canto 21

Having arrived in the seventh heaven (Saturn), Beatrice explains that her beauty has grown so intense that if she smiled, the narrator would be destroyed like Semele. She directs him to prepare his eyes to behold the new souls who are about to appear in this sphere. The narrator reflects on the equal pleasure he derives from gazing at Beatrice and from obeying her commands.

In the Heaven of Saturn, the narrator sees a golden ladder ascending beyond sight, with countless brilliant souls descending it like a flock of birds. One soul stops near him, glowing with love. The narrator hesitates to speak, but Beatrice, who perceives his unspoken questions in the mind of God, encourages him to voice them. He then asks the soul two things: why it has drawn so near, and why the celestial music heard in the other spheres is silent in this one.

A soul in the Heaven of Saturn explains to the narrator that there is no singing because his mortal senses could not bear it, just as they could not bear Beatrice's smile. The soul explains it descended not from greater love than the others, but by divine allotment. When the narrator asks why this specific soul was predestined for this task, the soul spins like a millstone and explains that the question of predestination is an abyss of divine decree, unknowable even to the highest angels, let alone to human minds on Earth. Humbled, the narrator abandons this line of questioning and asks the soul for its name.

The soul identifies himself as Peter Damian, a contemplative hermit from the monastery of Fonte Avellana on Monte Catria. He describes his simple, ascetic life there, laments the current corruption of his monastery, and recounts how he was reluctantly made a cardinal near the end of his life, a position he sees as perpetually declining in virtue.

Peter Damian concludes his speech by contrasting the humble, ascetic lives of St. Peter and St. Paul with the luxury of modern church leaders, who are so fat they need attendants to help them onto their horses. He compares the cleric and his horse to "two beasts under one skin." As he finishes, the other contemplative souls descend, spinning and growing more beautiful. They gather around him and let out a tremendous cry that overwhelms the narrator with its thunderous sound, rendering it incomprehensible to him.

## Canto 22

Overwhelmed by a thunderous cry, the narrator turns to Beatrice, who comforts him and explains that the cry was a prayer for divine vengeance, which he will see unfold before he dies. She urges him to look at the other souls, and he sees a hundred brilliant spheres. The largest and brightest, identifying itself as St. Benedict, comes forward. Benedict explains he founded the monastery at Monte Cassino, converting the pagan locals. He then points out other great contemplative saints like Macarius and Romuald.

Dante asks St. Benedict if he can see his true form. Benedict replies that this will only be possible in the Empyrean, the highest heaven, which their ladder ascends to. Benedict then laments the corruption of his monastic order, comparing it to the humble beginnings of St. Peter, himself, and St. Francis. He expresses faith that God will miraculously intervene to correct this decay. Finally, Benedict and the other contemplative souls gather and ascend the golden ladder like a whirlwind.

Urged by Beatrice, the narrator ascends the golden ladder with supernatural speed, arriving in the eighth heaven, the sphere of the Fixed Stars, within his birth constellation, Gemini. He invokes his natal stars for strength. Beatrice then instructs him to look down through the seven celestial spheres he has traversed to see the insignificance of the Earth. He gazes upon the planets and the whole Earth—the 'little threshing-floor'—before turning his eyes back to Beatrice.

## Canto 23

In the Heaven of the Fixed Stars, Beatrice waits expectantly for a celestial vision, compared to a mother bird awaiting the dawn. The heavens brighten, and she announces the arrival of the Triumph of Christ: a brilliant sun (Christ) that illuminates thousands of lesser lights (the saints). The narrator is overwhelmed by this vision of divine glory and by the intense joy radiating from Beatrice's face.

Beatrice explains to the overwhelmed Dante that he has just witnessed the power of Christ. After this vision, Dante's mind expands beyond its own limits. Beatrice tells him that he has now been strengthened enough to bear her smile. Dante, struggling with the ineffability of the experience, declares that not even the Muses could help him describe her divine smile and that he must "leap over" this part of the poem. He concludes by appealing to the reader's understanding of the immense difficulty of his task.

Beatrice urges Dante to look away from her and toward the 'beautiful garden' of saints, now visible after Christ's intense light has withdrawn. She identifies the Virgin Mary as the 'rose' of the Incarnation and the Apostles as the 'lilies.' Dante's eyes, now recovered, behold the multitudes of splendors. He focuses on Mary, the brightest light, and sees a torch-like angel, Gabriel, descend to circle her like a crown.

The angel Gabriel sings a hymn to the Virgin Mary, whom he calls the "beautiful sapphire." He explains he is "angelic love" and will circle her as she ascends to her Son. After Mary ascends beyond Dante's sight, the remaining saints stretch their lights upward in love and sing the "Regina Coeli." Dante marvels at these souls, who earned their heavenly reward through earthly suffering. He then sees St. Peter, holder of the keys, triumphing alongside Christ and the saints of both the Old and New Testaments.

## Canto 24

Beatrice addresses the company of saints, asking them to examine Dante before his death. The souls spin joyfully, and one, St. Peter, emerges. Beatrice asks him to question Dante on the topic of Faith. Dante prepares for the examination like a university student preparing for a master's questions.

St. Peter examines the narrator on the nature of Faith. The narrator defines faith using St. Paul's words and successfully explains its theological meaning as both the substance of hope and the evidence of the unseen. He then affirms his personal possession of this 'coin' of faith, explaining he received it through the Old and New Testaments, whose truth is proven by the miracles that followed, chief among them being the spread of Christianity itself. The celestial court approves with a song of praise.

St. Peter asks Dante to state the substance and origin of his faith. Dante professes his belief in one eternal, unmoved God and the Trinity, citing both philosophical reason and, more importantly, biblical revelation. Pleased with this confession, St. Peter, the "apostolic light," joyfully circles Dante three times, singing a blessing.

## Canto 25

Dante expresses a poignant hope that his sacred poem, which has cost him years of toil, will overcome his exile from Florence. He imagines returning not as a youth but as a mature poet, to be crowned with the laurel wreath at the very baptismal font where he entered the faith—the same faith for which St. Peter has just given him a heavenly blessing.

Beatrice introduces St. James, who greets St. Peter. Beatrice then asks James to examine Dante on the virtue of Hope. James tells Dante to be confident and poses three questions: what Hope is, how he has it, and its source. Before Dante can reply, Beatrice intercedes, attesting to Dante's great hope and explaining that he is allowed this journey for that reason. She then yields the floor to Dante to answer two of the questions himself.

Dante responds to St. James's examination on Hope. He defines it as a certain expectation of future glory, citing King David and St. James's epistle as his sources. In response to James's next question, Dante explains that the object of hope is the resurrection of the body and eternal life with God, as promised by Isaiah and St. John in the Bible. His answers are met with celestial approval, first from a flashing light within St. James, and then by a hymn sung by all the souls.

A new, brilliant soul, identified by Beatrice as St. John the Evangelist, joins St. Peter and St. James. Beatrice explains that this is the apostle who rested on Christ's breast and was entrusted with caring for Mary at the cross. The soul joins the others in a celestial song and dance as Beatrice looks on.

The narrator stares at St. John, trying to see if he has his physical body, and is temporarily blinded by the intense light. St. John's voice corrects him, stating that only Christ and Mary ascended with their bodies, and his own remains on Earth until the Last Judgment. After this clarification, the celestial dance and song stop abruptly. The narrator, now blind, turns toward Beatrice but finds he cannot see her, a fact that causes him great distress.

## Canto 26

Dante, temporarily blinded by St. John's light, is examined by the saint on the nature of Charity (Love). Assured that Beatrice will restore his sight, Dante first answers abstractly, stating that his love is directed toward God as the ultimate good, a truth revealed by both philosophical reason (Aristotle) and divine revelation (the Bible, especially John's own Gospel). St. John pushes for a more personal confession, asking what specific "bites" of love have drawn Dante's heart to God. Dante then lists the foundations of his love: Creation, the Crucifixion, the hope of salvation, and all of God's works, which he loves in proportion to the good they receive from their Creator.

As Dante finishes speaking, a celestial song of approval resounds. Beatrice, with the ray of her eyes, restores Dante's sight, making it clearer than before. Dante is astonished to see a fourth light, whom Beatrice identifies as Adam, the first soul ever created. Overcome with awe, Dante bows his head, and is then filled with a burning desire to speak.

Dante addresses Adam, the first created soul. Adam, able to read Dante's mind in God, answers his four unasked questions. He clarifies that his sin was not tasting the fruit but disobeying a command. He reveals he spent 930 years on Earth and 4,302 years in Limbo. He explains that the original human language he spoke became extinct long before the Tower of Babel, as all human languages change over time, and even the name for God changed from "I" to "El". Finally, he reveals that he was in the Garden of Eden for only about seven hours before the Fall.

## Canto 27

All of Paradise sings the "Gloria Patri," overwhelming the narrator with a joy that seems like the smile of the universe. He sees the four souls who examined him (Peter, James, John, and Adam). St. Peter's light begins to glow more brightly and turns red, like the planet Jupiter taking on the color of Mars. Then, divine Providence silences the heavenly choir, preparing for what is to come.

St. Peter delivers a furious invective against the corrupt papacy, specifically his usurper on Earth (Boniface VIII). His rage causes all of Heaven to turn red. He condemns the avarice and warmongering of modern popes, contrasting them with the early martyrs who died for the faith. He prophesies that divine Providence will soon intervene and commands Dante to reveal everything he has heard upon his return to the world.

The triumphant souls ascend back into the Empyrean. On Beatrice's instruction, Dante looks back down at the Earth, seeing how far he has traveled and perceiving the planet as a tiny, insignificant 'threshing-floor.' He then turns his gaze back to Beatrice, whose beauty surpasses all earthly art and nature, and her glance propels him from the eighth heaven (Gemini) up into the ninth and swiftest heaven, the Primum Mobile.

Beatrice explains the nature of the ninth heaven, the Primum Mobile, as the origin of all motion and time, located only in the Divine Mind. She then laments humanity's corruption, explaining how children lose their innocence and become avaricious and wicked due to the lack of proper governance on Earth. She concludes with a prophecy that this corrupt state of affairs will be corrected by divine intervention, turning the 'ship of state' around and bringing true fruit after the initial flower.

## Canto 28

After Beatrice finishes her discourse, the narrator turns to look into her eyes, which act as a mirror reflecting a new vision. He sees an intensely bright point of light—representing God—surrounded by nine concentric, fiery circles representing the angelic orders. The narrator describes the immense speed and brightness of these circles, noting a key difference from the physical cosmos: here, the circles closest to the central point are the fastest and most brilliant, with speed and light diminishing with distance from the center.

Dante is confused why the spiritual model of the angelic circles (smallest and fastest are closest to God) is the inverse of the physical cosmos (largest and fastest spheres are farthest from Earth). Beatrice explains that the size of a physical sphere is proportional to the divine virtue it contains, which is bestowed by its corresponding angelic mover. Therefore, the largest physical sphere (Primum Mobile) corresponds to the innermost, most virtuous angelic circle (the Seraphim), resolving the apparent paradox.

After Beatrice clarifies a paradox, the nine angelic circles sparkle with joy. Beatrice identifies the orders in three triads: Seraphim, Cherubim, and Thrones; Dominions, Virtues, and Powers; and Principalities, Archangels, and Angels. She explains that heavenly blessedness is founded on the act of seeing God (intellect), from which love follows as a consequence. She describes how all these orders gaze upward toward God and, in turn, draw the orders below them upward, creating a great celestial chain of influence.

Beatrice explains that Dionysius the Areopagite correctly identified and named the nine angelic orders. She contrasts this with Pope Gregory the Great, who proposed a different order and, upon arriving in Heaven, smiled at his own mistake. She concludes by telling Dante not to be surprised that a mortal like Dionysius knew such a secret truth, as it was revealed to him by someone (St. Paul) who had seen it directly in Heaven.

## Canto 29

Beatrice explains the creation of the universe. She refutes Dante's unspoken questions about *why*, *how*, and *when* creation occurred. She states that God created everything not to gain good for Himself, but out of love, so that His creation could reflect His existence. The entire universe—pure form (angels), pure matter, and their combination—was created instantaneously. She refutes St. Jerome's theory that angels were created long before the world, citing both scripture and reason.

Beatrice explains that the fall of the rebel angels happened almost instantaneously after their creation. The loyal angels remained, humbly recognizing their powers came from God, and were thus rewarded with grace and a steadfast will. Beatrice corrects the earthly scholastic error that angels possess memory, explaining that since their vision of God is continuous and uninterrupted, they have no need to recall past concepts. She concludes by condemning earthly philosophers who speculate falsely, dreaming while awake.

Beatrice condemns the intellectual vanity of earthly philosophers and preachers. She criticizes them for twisting or ignoring Scripture in favor of their own clever inventions to gain fame. She gives an example of a foolish astronomical theory used in a sermon and laments that the common people (the 'little sheep') are fed spiritual 'wind' instead of truth. She contrasts this corruption with the original mission of the Apostles, who fought for the faith with the Gospel as their only weapon. She concludes by decrying the sale of false indulgences, which enrich corrupt friars (like 'Saint Anthony's pig') and lead the credulous astray.

Beatrice concludes her explanation of the angelic orders, describing their incomprehensibly vast but finite number. She explains that each angel acts as a unique mirror, receiving and reflecting God's light, and that their love for God varies in intensity according to their unique vision of Him. This demonstrates God's power to multiply His reflection in countless beings while remaining eternally one.

## Canto 30

The vision of the angelic triumph fades from sight, much like stars disappearing at dawn. Dante turns back to Beatrice, whose beauty has now surpassed all his previous descriptions and, he believes, all human comprehension. He declares his poetic powers utterly defeated by this sight, stating he has reached the absolute limit of his art and can no longer follow her beauty with his verse.

Dante leaves the description of Beatrice's ultimate beauty to a greater poet and listens as she announces their arrival in the Empyrean, the heaven of pure light. Here, she says, he will see the saints in their resurrected forms. A flash of living light envelops Dante, preparing him and strengthening his sight to a new, superhuman level. He then sees a vision of a great river of light, with flower-lined banks. Living sparks (angels) fly from the river to the flowers (saints) and back again, like rubies set in gold.

Beatrice tells the narrator that to understand the vision of the river of light, he must first drink from its waters to strengthen his sight. When the narrator bends to the river and touches it with his eyes, the vision transforms from a linear river into a circular one. The sparks and flowers (angels and saints) reveal their true forms, no longer symbolic prefaces but the manifest reality of the two courts of Heaven. Overwhelmed, the narrator prays for the ability to describe this ultimate triumph.

The narrator describes the Empyrean, the heaven of pure light. This light, reflected from the Primum Mobile, forms an immense circle into which all the blessed souls are gathered, arranged in thousands of tiers like a celestial white rose. Despite its vastness, the narrator's sight can take in the entire spectacle, as the physical laws of distance do not apply in the direct presence of God.

Beatrice draws the narrator into the center of the Celestial Rose and points out its vastness. She shows him an empty throne reserved for the future Emperor Henry VII, prophesying his failed mission to unify a corrupt Italy. She then foretells the damnation of Pope Clement V, who will betray Henry and be sent to the circle of the simonists, pushing his predecessor, Boniface VIII, even deeper into Hell.

## Canto 31

The narrator beholds the Celestial Rose, a vast amphitheater formed by the ranks of the saints. He sees a second host, the angels, flying between the Rose and God, imparting peace and divine ardor, much like bees flitting between flowers and their hive. Overwhelmed with an astonishment greater than that of a barbarian seeing Rome for the first time, Dante gazes around this heavenly kingdom, absorbing the sight of the blessed souls like a pilgrim in a holy temple.

Dante turns to question Beatrice but finds St. Bernard in her place. Bernard explains Beatrice has returned to her throne in the Celestial Rose and will now guide Dante. Dante sees Beatrice from afar and offers a heartfelt prayer, thanking her for leading him from sin to salvation. She smiles at him before turning her gaze back to God.

St. Bernard, who has been sent to help Dante complete his journey, instructs him to gaze upon the Celestial Rose. This act will prepare his sight to ascend to God. Bernard, as Mary's faithful devotee, assures Dante of her grace. Dante looks upon Bernard with the awe of a pilgrim seeing the Veronica relic. Bernard then directs Dante to look to the highest circle of the Rose to see Mary, the queen of Heaven. Dante sees her, a point of brilliant light at the summit, brighter than the rest of the Rose, surrounded by thousands of unique, celebrating angels. Her beauty brings joy to all the saints. Seeing Dante's rapt attention, Bernard turns his own loving gaze to Mary, which intensifies Dante's own adoration.

## Canto 32

St. Bernard, acting as Dante's teacher, explains the seating arrangement of the Celestial Rose. He points out Eve sitting at Mary's feet, and then Rachel and Beatrice in the row below. He describes a vertical dividing line made of Hebrew women. On one side are the saints of the Old Testament who believed in Christ to come; this side is full. On the other side are the New Testament saints, a section still being filled. Opposite Mary's throne is that of John the Baptist, under whom sit other great saints like Francis, Benedict, and Augustine. Bernard concludes by explaining that divine providence will ensure both halves of the rose are equally filled by the Last Judgment.

St. Bernard explains the theology of infant salvation to Dante. He points to the lower half of the Celestial Rose, where souls are seated not by their own merit but by God's grace, having died before they could make their own choices. Bernard dispels Dante's doubt by affirming that there is no randomness in Heaven; God endows each soul with a different capacity for grace at creation, which determines their rank. He uses the biblical example of Jacob and Esau to illustrate this predestination. Finally, he outlines the different historical requirements for infant salvation: faith of the parents and circumcision in the Old Testament, and perfect baptism in the Christian era, without which such souls remain in Limbo.

St. Bernard directs Dante to look at the Virgin Mary, the face most like Christ's, as only her brightness can prepare him for that sight. Dante is overcome with a new level of wonder, watching the Archangel Gabriel descend and sing "Ave, Maria." Dante asks Bernard to identify the figures in the Celestial Rose. Bernard points out Adam, St. Peter, St. John the Evangelist, and Moses next to Mary. Opposite them, he identifies St. Anne and St. Lucia. He then explains they must stop because time is short and prepare Dante for the final vision by praying to Mary for grace.

## Canto 33

St. Bernard offers a sublime prayer to the Virgin Mary on Dante's behalf. He praises her paradoxical role in salvation (Virgin Mother, daughter of her Son) and her powerful intercession for humanity. He asks her to grant Dante the grace to see the final vision of God and to protect him from human frailty after witnessing such a profound mystery. He notes that Beatrice and all the blessed join him in this supplication.

After Mary signals her acceptance of St. Bernard's prayer, Dante turns to God. His sight, now pure, penetrates the divine light, and he experiences a vision that surpasses both speech and memory. Comparing this fading memory to a dream or snow melting in the sun, Dante prays to God for the power to recall and relate even a tiny spark of this glory. Emboldened by grace, he fixes his gaze upon the eternal light, pressing on until his sight is completely consumed within the vision of God's infinite goodness.

Dante describes his vision of the unity of all creation within God, bound by love like a book. He struggles to articulate the experience, explaining that his memory fails him more profoundly than the 25 centuries that have passed since the voyage of the Argo. He explains that in God, the ultimate good, his will found its perfect object, making it impossible to look away. He asserts that the divine light he saw was single and unchanging, but it seemed to transform as his own power of sight grew stronger.

Dante describes his ultimate vision of God as three concentric circles of different colors but the same dimension, representing the Trinity. The second circle, the Son, miraculously contains a human image (the Incarnation). Unable to comprehend this mystery through reason, like a geometer trying to square the circle, Dante's mind is struck by a flash of divine insight. His journey ends as his personal desire and will are perfectly aligned with the divine Love that moves the universe.
