A richly detailed, cinematic illustration of three iconic figures from Dante Alighieriâ€™s Divine Comedy. In the foreground stands Dante, a solemn medieval poet in a crimson robe and laurel wreath, holding a manuscript, his expression filled with awe and contemplation. Beside him is Virgil, the ancient Roman poet, wearing a flowing toga in muted ivory and pale blue, his face wise and calm, gesturing forward as a guide. In the distance, bathed in a radiant golden light, is Beatrice, a luminous, ethereal woman in a flowing gown of white and gold, her presence serene and divine, symbolizing love and salvation. The setting transitions from the dark, jagged shadows of the Inferno on one side, through the soft, ascending terraces of Purgatory in the middle, to the dazzling, celestial spheres of Paradise on the other. The sky blends deep crimson and indigo into brilliant gold and white, filled with symbolic stars and halos. The style should be highly detailed, painterly, and inspired by Renaissance masters, with dramatic lighting, rich textures, and a sense of spiritual grandeur. The composition should convey a journey from darkness to light, with each character embodying their symbolic role.
